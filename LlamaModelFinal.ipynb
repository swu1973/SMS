        "Goal: To implement an AI model to efficiently gather a researcher's expertise based on their abstracts in the Astrophysics Data System (ADS). The AI model results will speed up the process of obtaining the best possible pool of proposal reviewers with relevant subject matter expertise. We will ultimatley input the names already in SMS, a database system used to create review panels, into the AI model and populate the expertise field with our results.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The code build's off of Mallory Helfenbein's (NASA HQ intern 2023) ReviewerExtractor codeV2. You must create an ADS account and obtain an api token: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/token. We input a list of researcher names into the codeV2 which searches by first author in ADS, gather their abstracts from 2003 to 2030, and returns the top 10 words, bigrams, and trigrams (give example sheet of researcher names for the github). From these n-grams, create a combined top words list.\n",

        "We used the llama3-70b-8192 model in groqCloud. You must create a groqCloud account and obtain an api key: https://console.groq.com/keys. The llama model takes in the combined top words for each researcher and will determine the expertise chosen from the AAS keywords: https://journals.aas.org/keywords-2013/. We first prompted the model to determine the general topics and then asked for the associated subtopics.\n",

        "- TextAnalysis.py: Python file that has all the functions in order to determine the top words, bigrams and trigrams in each publication.\n",

        "Limitations:\n",
        "- We are searching only by first author names and if the name is common the expertise may not be accurate --> maybe for those people input institution as well (see codeV2)\n",
        "- We are trusting the formatting of the llama model output but there may be cases where the format is different so manual work may be required, such as re-running certain researchers through the model again\n",
        "- It takes about 4 minutes to run 10 researchers\n",

The collective behavior of plasmas that produce these emission signatures is still poorly understood. In order to allow modeling emission signatures from first principles, I construct radiative kinetic plasma simulations of these extreme plasma environments. In this talk I describe applications of these methods to understand the long-standing problem of the generation of coherent radio waves. I show that polar radio emission is directly produced by non-stationary plasma discharges in the polar cap. I also describe how mergers of magnetic islands in the reconnecting current sheet beyond the light cylinder can power high-power giant pulses and nano shots observed from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder., The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma.We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations., A range of long-standing problems in black-hole astrophysics have recently become accessible to detailed investigation by the advent of general-relativistic and radiation methods for particle-based kinetic plasma simulations, as well as GPU-accelerated three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics codes. We propose to use our unique, state-ofthe- art computational tools to study (a) the behavior of black-hole magnetospheres in which plasma is supplied by self-consistent pair creation and radiative signatures of pair discharges near the event horizon; (b) dynamics and radiative output of reconnection-powered flares in magnetically arrested accretion flows; (c) the global evolution of accretion-disk coronae with both spacetime curvature and radiation effects, and (d) X-ray emission powered by radiative magnetic reconnection in the coronae of thin accretion disks. This research has broad relevance to NASA science, as it principally aims to understand X-ray and gamma-ray observations by Chandra, NuSTAR, and Fermi. We expect this work to have a broad impact on the field, from stimulating further technical developments in ever more realistic astrophysical plasma simulations, to aiding the interpretation of observations of individual sources., Accretion flows onto primary targets of the Event Horizon Telescope, M87* and SgrA*, consist of collisionless plasmas. It is yet unknown how microphysical instabilities in these plasmas affect the dynamics of the flow, and how non-thermal particles are produced during observed spectacular multi-wavelength flares. In this talk I will show results of first-principles two-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations which address these fundamental questions. Large separation of microscopic (ion gyroradius) and macroscopic (black hole event horizon) scales in the simulation allows to probe the importance of mirror and firehose instabilities during the quiescent accretion, as well as the dynamics of magnetic reconnection and creation of electron-positron pair plasma in the flaring state., Since pulsars were discovered as emitters of bright coherent radio emission more than half a century ago, the cause of the emission has remained a mystery. In this Letter we demonstrate that coherent radiation can be directly generated in nonstationary pair plasma discharges which are responsible for filling the pulsar magnetosphere with plasma. By means of large-scale two-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations, we show that if pair creation is nonuniform across magnetic field lines, the screening of electric field by freshly produced pair plasma is accompanied by the emission of waves which are electromagnetic in nature. Using localized simulations of the screening process, we identify these waves as superluminal ordinary (O ) modes, which should freely escape from the magnetosphere as the plasma density drops along the wave path. The spectrum of the waves is broadband and the frequency range is comparable to that of observed pulsar radio emission., In this talk I will review the growing evidence of the importance of relativistic magnetic reconnection in powering observed emission from black holes and neutron stars. I will focus on the role of reconnection in accretion flows and jets from black holes and in magnetospheres of pulsars, magnetars and binary neutron stars before the merger., In this Letter we propose that coherent radio emission of the Crab pulsar, other young energetic pulsars, and millisecond pulsars is produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. We carry out global and local 2D kinetic plasma simulations of reconnection to illustrate the coherent emission mechanism. Reconnection in the current sheet beyond the light cylinder proceeds in the very efficient plasmoid-dominated regime, where the current layer gets fragmented into a dynamic chain of plasmoids that undergo successive coalescence. Mergers of sufficiently large plasmoids produce secondary perpendicular current sheets, which are also plasmoid unstable. Collisions of plasmoids with each other and with the upstream magnetic field eject fast magnetosonic waves, which propagate upstream across the background field and successfully escape from the plasma as electromagnetic waves that fall in the radio band. This model successfully explains many important features of the observed radio emission from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder: phase coincidence with the high-energy emission, nanosecond duration (nanoshots), and extreme instantaneous brightness of individual pulses., We perform global particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar magnetospheres, including pair production, ion extraction from the surface, frame-dragging corrections, and high-energy photon emission and propagation. In the case of oblique rotators, the effects of general relativity increase the fraction of the open field lines that support active pair discharge. We find that the plasma density and particle energy flux in the pulsar wind are highly non-uniform with latitude. A significant fraction of the outgoing particle energy flux is carried by energetic ions, which are extracted from the stellar surface. Their energies may extend up to a large fraction of the open field line voltage, making them interesting candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. We show that pulsar gamma-ray radiation is dominated by synchrotron emission, produced by particles that are energized by relativistic magnetic reconnection close to the Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet. In most cases, the calculated light curves contain two strong peaks, which is in general agreement with Fermi observations. The radiative efficiency decreases with increasing pulsar inclination and increasing efficiency of pair production in the current sheet, which explains the observed scatter in L <SUB> \\u03b3 </SUB> versus \\\\dot{E}. We find that the high-frequency cutoff in the spectra is regulated by the pair-loading of the current sheet. Our findings lay the foundation for quantitative interpretation of Fermi observations of gamma-ray pulsars., Radial transport of particles, elements and fluid driven by internal stresses in three-dimensional (3D) astrophysical accretion disks is an important phenomenon, potentially relevant for the outward dust transport in protoplanetary disks, origin of the refractory particles in comets, isotopic equilibration in the Earth-Moon system, etc. To gain better insight into these processes, we explore the dependence of meridional circulation in 3D disks with shear viscosity on their thermal stratification, and demonstrate a strong effect of the latter on the radial flow. Previous locally isothermal studies have normally found a pattern of the radial outflow near the midplane, switching to inflow higher up. Here we show, both analytically and numerically, that a flow that is inward at all altitudes is possible in disks with entropy and temperature steeply increasing with height. Such thermodynamic conditions may be typical in the optically thin, viscously heated accretion disks. Disks in which these conditions do not hold should feature radial outflow near the midplane, as long as their internal stress is provided by the shear viscosity. Our results can also be used for designing hydrodynamical disk simulations with a prescribed pattern of the meridional circulation., The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope greatly increased the number of known pulsars in the gamma-ray band. It was discovered that pulsars often emit a significant fraction of their spin-down energy in gamma-rays, offering a new powerful diagnostic tool of neutron star magnetic field structure. The modeling of gamma-ray data suggests that in order to interpret the observations one needs to understand the field geometry and the plasma state in the emission region. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the magnetospheric structure in the limit of abundant plasma supply, the so-called force-free limit. I used force-free solutions to study the time evolution of the pulsar's obliquity angle. I showed that pulsar rotation and magnetic axes evolve toward alignment as a power-law in time, in broad agreement with observations. Despite the success of the force-free approach for understanding the global field geometry, the location of the emission region and radiation mechanism remained a mystery. To address this from first principles, in this thesis I developed kinetic three dimensional simulations of pulsar magnetospheres which include the physics of plasma production and particle acceleration. I found that the state of the magnetosphere crucially depends on the way charges are introduced into the magnetosphere. In simulations with self-consistent pair production I found several solutions with qualitatively different plasma distribution in the open field line region depending on the inclination of the pulsar. In a surprising finding, I discovered that GR effects help to establish efficient particle acceleration and pair production near the surface of low obliquity pulsars. Finally, I performed GR kinetic simulations of oblique rotators and showed that pulsar high-energy emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation emitted by particles that are energized by magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet. The computed lightcurves and spectra of high-energy emission reproduce the observed morphology of gamma-ray pulsars., Disk accretion at a high rate onto a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star has been suggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (SL)\\u2014a belt-like structure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadily spreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. To assess its basic characteristics, we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for cooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of the SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large-scale acoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the transport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be characterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g., \\u03b1-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have important implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives effective rearrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties of the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and susceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this evolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of the SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only at intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has decelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is dominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. We speculate that this latitudinal nonuniformity of mixing in accreting WDs may be linked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical nova ejecta., It has recently been demonstrated that self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations of low-obliquity pulsar magnetospheres in flat spacetime show weak particle acceleration and no pair production near the poles. We investigate the validity of this conclusion in a more realistic spacetime geometry via general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the aligned pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. We find that the addition of the frame-dragging effect makes the local current density along the magnetic field larger than the Goldreich-Julian value, which leads to unscreened parallel electric fields and the ignition of a pair cascade. When pair production is active, we observe field oscillations in the open field bundle, which could be related to pulsar radio emission. We conclude that general-relativistic effects are essential for the existence of the pulsar mechanism in low-obliquity rotators., We present \\u201cfirst-principles\\u201d relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron pairs. We inject secondary pairs at the locations of primary energetic particles whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with the Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities \\u226440\\u00b0 do not show pair production in the open field line region because the local current density along the magnetic field is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is charge-separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the bulk flow and the size of the pair-producing region increasing with inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet ranges between 20% for the aligned rotator and 3% for the orthogonal rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region, e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our simplified model, such as the effects of curved spacetime or multipolar surface fields., The rotational period of isolated pulsars increases over time due to the extraction of angular momentum by electromagnetic torques. These torques also change the obliquity angle \\u03b1 between the magnetic and rotational axes. Although actual pulsar magnetospheres are plasma filled, the time evolution of \\u03b1 has mostly been studied for vacuum pulsar magnetospheres. In this work, we self-consistently account for the plasma effects for the first time by analysing the results of time-dependent 3D force-free and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of pulsar magnetospheres. We show that if a neutron star is spherically symmetric and is embedded with a dipolar magnetic moment, the pulsar evolves so as to minimize its spin-down luminosity: both vacuum and plasma-filled pulsars evolve towards the aligned configuration (\\u03b1 = 0). However, they approach the alignment in qualitatively different ways. Vacuum pulsars come into alignment exponentially fast, with \\u03b1 \\u221d exp (-t/\\u03c4) and \\u03c4 \\u223c spin-down time-scale. In contrast, we find that plasma-filled pulsars align much more slowly, with \\u03b1 \\u221d (t/\\u03c4)<SUP>-1/2</SUP>. We argue that the slow time evolution of obliquity of plasma-filled pulsars can potentially resolve several observational puzzles, including the origin of normal pulsars with periods of \\u223c1 s, the evidence that oblique pulsars come into alignment over a time-scale of \\u223c10<SUP>7</SUP> yr, and the observed deficit, relative to an isotropic obliquity distribution, of pulsars showing interpulse emission., We perform \\\"first-principles\\\" relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of aligned pulsar magnetosphere. We allow free escape of particles from the surface of a neutron star and continuously populate the magnetosphere with neutral pair plasma to imitate pair production. As pair plasma supply increases, we observe the transition from a charge-separated \\\"electrosphere\\\" solution with trapped plasma and no spin-down to a solution close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with electromagnetically dominated pulsar wind. We calculate the magnetospheric structure, current distribution, and spin-down power of the neutron star. We also discuss particle acceleration in the equatorial current sheet., The eclipsing binary DI Herculis (DI Her) is known to exhibit anomalously slow apsidal precession below the rate predicted by general relativity. Recent measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate that stellar spins in DI Her are almost orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum, which explains the anomalous precession in agreement with the earlier theoretical suggestion by Shakura. However, these measurements yield only projections of the spin-orbit angles onto the sky plane, leaving the spin projection onto our line of sight unconstrained. Here we describe a method for determining the full three-dimensional spin orientation of the binary components relying on the use of the gravity-darkening effect, which is significant for the rapidly rotating stars in DI Her. Gravity darkening gives rise to a nonuniform brightness distribution over the stellar surface, the pattern of which depends on the stellar spin orientation. Using archival photometric data obtained during multiple eclipses over several decades, we are able to constrain the unknown spin angles in DI Her with this method, finding that the spin axes of both stars lie close to the plane of the sky. Our procedure fully accounts for the precession of stellar spins over the long time span of observations.\",\n          \"DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) is the effort to digitize the majority of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) Astronomical Photographic Glass Plate Collection, a set of ~550,000 images of the night sky spanning more than a century of observations. With the support of HCO, DASCH scanning is resuming after a hiatus of more than two years. At the time of the writing of this abstract (late September, 2023), scanning is 96% complete with an estimated ~6 months required to finish. Efforts are underway to make the complete DASCH lightcurve collection available for analysis, enhancing a unique resource for time-domain astrophysics. Work is also ongoing to expose the full richness of the collection in a sophisticated web interface that will interlink the scientific data with archival and historical information, centering the \\\"women astronomical computers\\\" without whose work this irreplaceable scientific asset would not exist. I will report the current status of the scanning effort, DASCH data availability, and the new web portal., In the Jupyter ecosystem, data visualization is usually done with \\\"widgets\\\" created as notebook cell outputs. While this mechanism works well in some circumstances, it is not well-suited to presenting interfaces that are long-lived, interactive, and visually rich. Unlike the traditional Jupyter notebook system, the newer JupyterLab application provides a sophisticated extension infrastructure that raises new design possibilities. Here we present a novel user experience (UX) for interactive data visualization in JupyterLab that is based on an \\\"app\\\" that runs alongside the user's notebooks, rather than widgets that are bound inside them. We have implemented this UX for the AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) visualization tool. JupyterLab's messaging APIs allow the app to smoothly exchange data with multiple computational kernels, allowing users to accomplish tasks that are not possible using the widget framework. A new Jupyter server extension allows the frontend to request data from kernels asynchronously over HTTP, enabling interactive exploration of gigapixel-scale imagery in WWT. While we have developed this UX for WWT, the overall design and the server extension are portable to other applications and have the potential to unlock a variety of new user activities that aren't currently possible in \\\"science platform\\\" interfaces., The principal data set on which this study is based is the 2019 data Release of the NEOWISE-R survey. The wavelengths of the W1 and W2 bands, 3.4 and 4.6\\u03bcm, are well placed for observing T<SUB>g</SUB>~1000-K circumstellar dust emission. The instrument has the sensitivity to cover the fainter and heavily reddened WR stars found in recent IR surveys, e.g. Mauerhan, Van Dyk &amp; Morris (2009PASP..121..591M), Shara et al. (2009AJ....138..402S) but, on the other hand, most of the WR dust emitters found in the earlier studies are too bright for NEOWISE-R, so there is little overlap with the earlier studies. <P />The observations were taken between late 2013 and late 2018. The cadence of the observations makes them most useful for studying variations over short (~1-2d) and long (~1-5yr) time-scales, of which the latter are of interest for the present investigation. <P />The NEOWISE-R Single Exposure Source Data base in the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) data were searched at the positions of all WC stars in V1.22 (http://pacrowther.staff.shef.ac.uk/WRcat/index.php, dated 2019 March) of the Galactic WR Catalogue (Rosslowe &amp; Crowther 2015MNRAS.447.2322R). <P />(19 data files)., Fast empirical models of the broad emission line region (BLR) are a powerful tool to interpret velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) data, estimate the mass of the supermassive black holes, and gain insight into its geometry and kinematics. Much of the effort so far has been devoted to describing the emissivity of one emission line at a time. We present here an alternative approach aimed at describing the underlying BLR gas distribution, by exploiting simple numerical recipes to connect it with emissivity. This approach is a step toward describing multiple emission lines originating from the same gas and allows us to clarify some issues related to the interpretation of RM data. We illustrate this approach-implemented in the code CARAMEL-GAS-using three data sets covering the H\\u03b2 emission line (Mrk 50, Mrk 1511, Arp 151) that have been modeled using the emissivity-based version of the code. As expected, we find differences in the parameters describing the BLR gas and emissivity distribution, but the emissivity-weighted lag measurements and all other model parameters including black hole mass and overall BLR morphology and kinematics are consistent with the previous measurements. We also model the H\\u03b1 emission line for Arp 151 using both the gas- and emissivity-based BLR models. We find ionization stratification in the BLR with H\\u03b1 arising at larger radii than H\\u03b2, while all other model parameters are consistent within the uncertainties., In the solar system, planetary magnetospheres are universally associated with trapped energetic charged particles. This suggests that such magnetospheric systems should be prevalent in the broader universe as well, and that we might be able to probe them with radio astronomical observations. Amidst the ongoing bonanza of exoplanetary discoveries, current observatories are unfortunately not expected to be able to detect Jupiter analogues, let alone terrestrial planets. But it turns out that radio astronomers do detect radio signals from ultracool dwarfs the very smallest stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects that indicate the presence of planet-like magnetospheres that are stable, dipole-dominated, and luminous in gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser emission. I will present radio studies of some of the most spectacular of these radio-active objects, where the extremely rich data require far more sophisticated emission modeling than astronomers typically employ. Because these objects are free-floating and may have masses dozens of times that of Jupiter with rotation periods less than two hours, understanding their radio emission should yield new insights into dynamo physics and the processes driving radiation belt energization., , We present the first ever models of a broad line region (BLR) at the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity using the multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745. The modeled data consist of monthly spectra covering the broad C IV emission line over a 5.3 yr baseline. The models suggest a thick disk BLR that is inclined by ~40\\u00b0 to the observer's line of sight and with an emissivity weighted median radius of ${r}_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={33.0}_{-2.1}^{+2.4}$ light days. The kinematics are dominated by near-circular Keplerian motion with the remainder inflowing. The rest-frame lag one would measure from the models is ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={36.4}_{-1.8}^{+1.8}$ days, which is consistent with measurements based on cross-correlation. We show a possible geometry and transfer function based on the model fits and find that the model-produced velocity-resolved lags are consistent with those from cross-correlation. We measure a black hole mass of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={8.31}_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ , which requires a scale factor of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })={0.20}_{-0.07}^{+0.09}$ . This is the most precise M<SUB>BH</SUB> measurement for any AGN at cosmological distances and it demonstrates that the precision required for BH-host coevolution studies is attainable., Candidates were observed using the Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2), the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI), the OH-Suppressing InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS), and the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) at Keck Observatory; the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2) at the New Technology Telescope; and the Adaptive Optics Module and Goodman Spectrograph at the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. In this campaign, we observed 56 total candidates (Table 1), including three new lenses and one known lens. <P />(1 data file)., The HERA Librarian system keeps track of all the primary data products for the telescope at a given site. The Librarian supports large data volumes and automated data processing capabilities. A web-based application handles human user and automatic requests and interfaces with a backing database and data storage servers. The system supports the long-term data storage of all relevant telescope data, as well as staging data to individual users' directories for processing., We present the first results of a 4.5 yr monitoring campaign of the three bright images of multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745 using the Gemini North Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Nordic Optical Telescope. We take advantage of gravitational time delays to construct light curves surpassing 6 yr in duration in the observed frame and achieve an average spectroscopic cadence of 10 days during the 8 months of visibility per season. Using multiple secondary calibrators and advanced reduction techniques, we achieve percent-level spectrophotometric precision and carry out an unprecedented reverberation mapping analysis, measuring both integrated and velocity-resolved time lags for the C IV emission line. The full line lags the continuum by ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={36.5}_{-3.9}^{+2.9}$ rest-frame days. We combine our measurement with published C IV emission line lags and derive the r<SUB>BLR</SUB> - L relationship ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}(\\\\tau /{\\\\rm{d}}{\\\\rm{a}}{\\\\rm{y}})=(0.99\\\\,\\\\pm 0.07)+(0.48\\\\pm 0.03){\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}[\\\\lambda {L}_{\\\\lambda }(1350\\\\,{\\\\rm{A}}{\\\\rm{A}})/{10}^{44}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{e}}{\\\\rm{r}}{\\\\rm{g}}{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}]$ with 0.30 \\u00b1 0.06 dex intrinsic scatter. The velocity-resolved lags are consistent with circular Keplerian orbits, with ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={86.2}_{-5.0}^{+4.5}$ , ${25}_{-15}^{+11}$ , and ${7.5}_{-3.5}^{+4.2}$ rest-frame days for the core, blue wing, and red wing, respectively. Using \\u03c3<SUB>line</SUB> with the mean spectrum and assuming ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })=0.52\\\\pm 0.26$ , we derive ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })=8.63\\\\pm 0.27$ . Given the quality of the data, this system represents a unique benchmark for calibration of M<SUB>BH</SUB> estimators at high redshift. Future work will present dynamical modeling of the data to constrain the virial factor f and M<SUB>BH</SUB>., There is overwhelming evidence for a link between supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies, yet the physical mechanisms behind the connection are poorly understood. Discerning between possible co-evolutionary scenarios requires precise measurements of BH masses and host properties across cosmic time. BH mass measurements outside the local universe require bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the AGN light overwhelms the light of the host, making host property measurements difficult. Further, BH mass estimates rely on the unresolvable broad emission line region (BLR), and the unknown nature of the BLR limits their precision. <P />In this dissertation, I use a unique combination of gravitational lensing and reverberation mapping techniques to tackle both issues. First, I present a semi-supervised classification approach for identifying rare lensed quasars based solely on photometry in wide-field surveys. Lenses are powerful tools for measuring host properties, but studies are limited by the small sample size, so discovery efforts are crucial. Using this technique, I successfully discovered three new lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with several other candidates awaiting further follow-up. This approach is flexible and can easily be modified to target specific types of lenses as well as lenses in surveys covering different portions of the sky. <P />Next, I use a modeling framework to measure precise BH masses for seven AGNs and infer the structural and kinematic properties of the H\\u03b1 BLR. This nearly doubles the sample size of modeled BLRs, allowing for a correlation analysis between BLR properties and AGN observables that can be used to improve BH mass measurements for all AGNs. I then model H\\u03b1, CIV, and Lya in NGC 5548 using data from 85 Hubble Space Telescope orbits and multiple ground-based telescopes to understand the similarities and differences between the optical and UV BLRs. High-z BH mass measurements rely on UV lines, but our current understanding of the UV BLR is severely lacking, so understanding their connection is critical for decreasing high-z BH mass uncertainties. Finally, I tie the previous projects together with the most precise high-z BH mass measurement to date, using data from a 4.5 year monitoring campaign of a strongly lensed quasar at z = 2.805. Accounting for gravitational time delays, the campaign exceeds 6 years in duration. Understanding the co-evolution of BHs and their hosts will require measurements of this precision at high-z, and this research demonstrates that gravitational lensing makes this level of precision obtainable., We present geometric and dynamical modeling of the broad line region (BLR) for the multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign focused on NGC 5548 in 2014. The data set includes photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical and ultraviolet, covering the H\\u03b2, C IV, and Ly\\u03b1 broad emission lines. We find an extended disk-like H\\u03b2 BLR with a mixture of near-circular and outflowing gas trajectories, while the C IV and Ly\\u03b1 BLRs are much less extended and resemble shell-like structures. There is clear radial structure in the BLR, with C IV the three lines, we make three independent black hole mass measurements, all of which are consistent. Combining these results gives a joint inference of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={7.64}_{-0.18}^{+0.21}$ . We examine the effect of using the V band instead of the UV continuum light curve on the results and find a size difference that is consistent with the measured UV-optical time lag, but the other structural and kinematic parameters remain unchanged, suggesting that the V band is a suitable proxy for the ionizing continuum when exploring the BLR structure and kinematics. Finally, we compare the H\\u03b2 results to similar models of data obtained in 2008 when the active galactic nucleus was at a lower luminosity state. We find that the size of the emitting region increased during this time period, but the geometry and black hole mass remained unchanged, which confirms that the BLR kinematics suitably gauge the gravitational field of the central black hole., Electronic publishing opens the possibility of conveying scientific content using visualisations that are interactive and exploratory, not just static images. The American Astronomical Society, publisher of the Astrophysical Journal and others, has been working to promote the use of \\\"interactive figures\\\" in its journals as part of a broader effort to keep its offerings on the technical forefront. This year, the AAS is launching new tools to ease the creation of interactive figures for two common data types: time series, using a new AAS Timeseries Tool, and sky images, using the AAS WorldWide Telescope. This item gives an overview of these tools and how you can start using them to share your data in a new, rich way., We finalize our tests of the Gaussian mixture model by examining how it classifies known lenses. Of a list of known lenses, 128 lie in the SDSS footprint for which we can obtain colours and calculate membership probabilities (table 2). <P />&gt;From our visual inspection scores, we have 43 objects with score greater than 1.5, after eliminating all contaminants based on the spectroscopic information. These are listed in Table 3 <P />(2 data files)., Photometry at 3.4 and 4.6 {\\u03bc m} of 128 Population I WC type Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and 12 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed in the WISE NEOWISE-R survey was searched for evidence of circumstellar dust emission and its variation. Infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were assembled, making use of archival r, i, Z, and Y photometry to determine reddening and stellar wind levels for the WC stars found in recent IR surveys and lacking optical photometry. From their SEDs, 10 apparently non-variable stars were newly identified as dust makers, including three, WR 102-22, WR 110-10, and WR 124-10, having subtype earlier than WC8-9, the first such stars to show this phenomenon. The 11 stars found to show variable dust emission include six new episodic dust makers, WR 47c, WR 75-11, WR 91-1, WR 122-14, and WR 125-1 in the Galaxy and HD 38030 in the LMC. Of previously known dust makers, NEOWISE-R photometry of WR 19 captured its rise to maximum in 2018 confirming the 10.1-yr period, that of WR 125 the beginning of a new episode of dust formation suggesting a period near 28.3 yr. while that of HD 36402 covered almost a whole period and forced revision of it to 5.1 yr., , We present models of the H\\u03b2-emitting broad-line region (BLR) in seven Seyfert 1 galaxies from the Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2011 sample, drawing inferences on the BLR structure and dynamics as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole. We find that the BLR is generally a thick disk, viewed close to face-on, with preferential emission back toward the ionizing source. The dynamics in our sample range from near-circular elliptical orbits to inflowing or outflowing trajectories. We measure black hole masses of {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({M}<SUB>BH</SUB>}/{M}<SUB>\\u2299 </SUB>)={6.48}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.21</SUP> for PG 1310-108, {7.50}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.25</SUP> for Mrk 50, {7.46}<SUB>-0.21</SUB><SUP>+0.15</SUP> for Mrk 141, {7.58}<SUB>-0.08</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP> for Mrk 279, {7.11}<SUB>-0.17</SUB><SUP>+0.20</SUP> for Mrk 1511, {6.65}<SUB>-0.15</SUB><SUP>+0.27</SUP> for NGC 4593, and {6.94}<SUB>-0.14</SUB><SUP>+0.14</SUP> for Zw 229-015. We use these black hole mass measurements along with cross-correlation time lags and line widths to recover the scale factor f used in traditional reverberation mapping measurements. Combining our results with other studies that use this modeling technique, which brings our sample size to 16, we calculate a scale factor that can be used for measuring black hole masses in other reverberation mapping campaigns. When using the root-mean-square (rms) spectrum and using the line dispersion to measure the line width, we find {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>rms</SUB>,\\u03c3 }) <SUB>pred</SUB> = 0.57 \\u00b1 0.19. Finally, we search for correlations between f and other AGN and BLR parameters and find marginal evidence that f is correlated with M <SUB>BH</SUB> and the BLR inclination angle, but no significant evidence of a correlation with the AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio., Low-frequency radio observations are believed to represent one of the few means of directly probing the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets. However, a half-century of low-frequency planetary observations within the Solar System demonstrate that detailed, physically-motivated magnetospheric models are needed to properly interpret the radio data. I will present recent work in this area focusing on the current state of the art: relatively high-frequency observations of relatively massive objects, which are now understood to have magnetospheres that are largely planetary in nature. I will highlight the key challenges that will arise in future space-based observations of lower-mass objects at lower frequencies., We present the discovery of three quasar lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using two novel photometry-based selection techniques. The J0941+0518 system, with two point sources separated by 5.46 arcsec on either side of a galaxy, has source and lens redshifts 1.54 and 0.343. Images of J2257+2349 show two point sources separated by 1.67 arcsec on either side of an E/S0 galaxy. The extracted spectra show two images of the same quasar at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.10. SDSS J1640+1045 has two quasar spectra at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.70 and fits to the SDSS and Pan-STARRS images confirm the presence of a galaxy between the two point sources. We observed 56 photometrically selected lens candidates in this follow-up campaign, confirming three new lenses, re-discovering one known lens, and ruling out 36 candidates, with 16 still inconclusive. This initial campaign demonstrates the power of purely photometric selection techniques in finding lensed quasars., I discuss three mutually-supportive notions or assumptions regarding jets and accretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the overwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady accreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The third is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading directly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that is simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect. For concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in accretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical work directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic (\\\"viscous\\\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective radiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission problem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar to breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar, permitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow than otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent, tangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an angular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve. Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate but to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then vertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then that jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar jets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven., The lowest mass brown dwarfs can, surprisingly, generate magnetic fields with kilogauss strengths, comparable to those of the most active M dwarfs. However their associated magnetic phenomenology is very different, with strong radio emission that has defied detailed interpretation thus far. I argue that these objects are best understood as scaled-up Jupiters, possessing rotation-dominated magnetospheres, rather than scaled-down stars. I present a new, publicly-available numerical model, \\\"vernon\\\", inspired by ones used to analyze the terrestrial and Jovian magnetospheres. Components include a steady-state Fokker-Planck solver, fast and accurate calculation of full-Stokes synchrotron radiative transfer coefficients, and fully polarized 3D radiative transfer integration. This new model finally makes it possible to relate the data to the detailed physical characteristics of these objects' magnetospheres., The photometric capabilities of the Helioseismic Imager aboard STEREO\\u2019s Ahead spacecraft (HI1A) have allowed the yearly observation of a large number of stars situated near the ecliptic over the past decade. While many reliable stellar variability analyses have been performed, unwanted artifacts may still exist in the data that sometimes manifest as false signals. Between May 22 and July 1, 2016, Kepler\\u2019s K2 mission executed the second part of Guest Observer Campaign 9 to study gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Coincidentally, during approximately two weeks of this campaign, HI1A was directed toward the same field of view, presenting a rare opportunity to compare the contemporaneous observations from both instruments looking at the same set of stars. Utilizing the high sensitivity of Kepler, undesirable artifacts within the observed HI1A photometric signals may be identified and removed. Additionally, intrinsic variations of these field stars, such as those with long periodicities, may be confirmed by calibrating the signals from HI1A with those from Kepler. These stars may subsequently undergo retrospective analyses using the available data from STEREO, which will provide further insights into their variability characteristics., The 2001 discovery of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types of \\u223cM7 and later, revealed that these objects can generate and dissipate powerful magnetic fields. Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures &lt;math xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"&gt; &lt;mo&gt;\\u2272&lt;/mo&gt; \\\\lesssim 1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves., ``Ultracool'' stars and brown dwarfs (cooler than 2700 K, spectral types M7 and later) are now known to be capable of generating and dissipating strong (kG) magnetic fields. Intriguingly, both observations and theory suggest that the dynamo process that drives the magnetic activity of these objects may in fact be bistable, operating in either a ``star-like'' or ``planet-like'' mode. Data that can further test this hypothesis are, however, scarce. In the past year, eight new cold (&lt;1500 K) brown dwarfs have been confirmed to be magnetically active from radio observations. Here we propose Chandra observations to test the bimodality hypothesis by investigating the ratios of their radio and X-ray luminosities, which distinguish the star-like and planet-like modes., We observed the position of the optical counterpart SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC 21529) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 2017 August 19 UT and 2017 August 26 UT. Each observation lasted 20 minutes and was performed using ALMA's Band 3, with spectral windows of 4 GHz bandwidth centered at 91.5 and 103.5 GHz. We have analyzed the data using a custom CASA-based pipeline. At a mean frequency of 97.5 GHz, we detect no emission at the location of the optical transient to a combined 3-sigma limit of 50 microJy. We detect a source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.2 mJy at the location: RA = 13:09:47.696 dec = -23:23:02.31 with a positional uncertainty of ~0.04 arcsec. This is consistent with the optical position of the host galaxy and the position of the radio source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC 21545) and others. We thank the ALMA staff, especially Tony Remijan, for their excellent support., We investigated observations of the candidate optical counterpart to LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 in the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) data archive. The field containing the candidate was observed at both 1.51 GHz (\\\"L band\\\") and 4.89 GHz (\\\"C band\\\") on June 10 and 23, 1984, as part of program AW0110. The on-source integration times were 11.5 and 5.5 minutes, respectively. We obtained images generated by the NRAO's VLA/AIPS data calibration pipeline (L. Sjouwerman, in preparation), which automatically processed the data in 2009. We see no persuasive evidence for radio emission at the location of either the host galaxy or the counterpart candidates. We measure image RMS values of ~180 and ~340 microJy near the candidates in the 1.51 and 4.89 GHz images, respectively. Taking a flux density upper limit of three times the RMS and a luminosity distance of 39.5 Mpc, these values correspond to upper limits on the spectral luminosity of 10^27.0 and 10^27.3 erg/s/Hz at 1.51 and 4.89 GHz. Using the relation between synchrotron emission and star formation rate presented by Yun &amp; Carilli (2002 ApJ 568 88), the implied star formation rate of the candidate host galaxy is less than 0.05 solar masses per year. For comparison, Alexander et al. (LVC GCNs 21545, 21548) report a VLA radio detection of 300 microJy at 9.77 GHz, and Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559) report ATCA radio detections of 600-400 microJy at 8.5--21.2 GHz. These values are consistent with the archival limits., HERA, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, is a long wavelength radio telescope under construction in South Africa. Although HERA's primary science driver is the search for radio signatures of the Epoch of Reionization, its large collecting area, excellent calibratability, and methodical observing scheme make it a world-class tool for time-domain radio astronomy as well. In particlar, the completed HERA array will be sensitive to auroral radio bursts from planets with auroral powers and magnetic field strengths comparable to (factors of a few larger than) those of Jupiter, assuming a fiducial distance of 10 pc. HERA will log thousands of hours monitoring the stellar systems in its sky footprint, including the 40 systems found within this fiducial horizon. In this talk I will describe the current status of HERA and its future prospects for directly detecting exoplanetary magnetospheres., Wide-field photometric surveys enable searches of rare yet interesting objects, such as strongly lensed quasars or quasars with a bright host galaxy. Past searches for lensed quasars based on their optical and near-infrared properties have relied on photometric cuts and spectroscopic preselection (as in the Sloan Quasar Lens Search), or neural networks applied to photometric samples. These methods rely on cuts in morphology and colours, with the risk of losing many interesting objects due to scatter in their population properties, restrictive training sets, systematic uncertainties in catalogue-based magnitudes and survey-to-survey photometric variations. Here, we explore the performance of a Gaussian mixture model to separate point-like quasars, quasars with an extended host and strongly lensed quasars using griz &lt;monospace&gt;psf&lt;/monospace&gt; and &lt;monospace&gt;model&lt;/monospace&gt; magnitudes and WISE W1, W2. The choice of optical magnitudes is due to their presence in all current and upcoming releases of wide-field surveys, whereas UV information is not always available. We then assess the contamination from blue galaxies and the role of additional features such as W3 magnitudes or &lt;monospace&gt;psf-model&lt;/monospace&gt; terms as morphological information. As a demonstration, we conduct a search in a random 10 per cent of the SDSS footprint, and provide the catalogue of the 43 SDSS object with the highest 'lens' score in our selection that survive visual inspection, and are spectroscopically confirmed to host active nuclei. We inspect archival data and find images of 5/43 objects in the Hubble Legacy Archive, including two known lenses. The code and materials are available to facilitate follow-up., pwkit is a collection of miscellaneous astronomical utilities in Python, with an emphasis on radio astronomy, reading and writing various data formats, and convenient command-line utilities. Utilities include basic astronomical calculations, data visualization tools such as mapping arbitrary data to color scales and tracing contours, and data input and output utilities such as streaming output from other programs., Route &amp; Wolszczan (2016) recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 brown dwarf WISEP J112254.7+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of ~17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission possibly with a period of 116 minutes, although our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to confirm it. Our proposed periodicity is typical of other radio-active ultracool dwarfs. The handedness of the circular polarization alternates with time and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Route &amp; Wolszczan recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 dwarf WISEP J112254.73+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of \\u223c17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission. Assuming that the radio emission of this T dwarf is periodically variable on \\u223chour timescales, like other radio-active ultracool dwarfs, we infer a likely period of 116 minutes. However, our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to test this hypothesis. The handedness of the circular polarization switches twice and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Radio studies show that, despite their low temperatures, very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can generate strong magnetic fields and accelerate ~MeV electrons. Strikingly, the resulting phenomenology resembles that of a scaled- up planet more than a scaled-down star, with aurorae and radiation belts thousands of times brighter than those of Jupiter. In both Jupiter and the \\\"ultracool dwarfs,\\\" radio emission traces energetic magnetospheric electrons. In Jupiter, many of these electrons eventually crash into the upper atmosphere, their energy driving haze production and vertical mixing. We do not know how efficiently magnetic energy is deposited in ultracool dwarf atmospheres, or the chemistry that this drives. This deposition leads to FUV emission, however, and we have recently calculated that the most radio-active ultracool dwarf, NLTT33370B, should produce enough FUV to be detectable with Hubble. We propose a 4-hour simultaneous VLA/HST observation to measure the impact of this deposition process. Using a novel VLA sub-arraying tactic, we will leverage well-vetted planetary radiation belt models to obtain an unprecendently detailed view of how electrons migrate through this dwarfs's inner magnetosphere. Hubble will probe their ultimate fate., The z ~ 0.5 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 has been proposed as the host of a radio transient associated with FRB 150418 (Keane et al., 2016 Nature 530 453)., Keane et al. have recently claimed to have obtained the first precise localization for a fast radio burst (FRB) thanks to the identification of a contemporaneous fading slow (\\u223cweek-timescale) radio transient. They use this localization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z\\u2248 0.49 that exhibits no discernible star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient. Therefore the claimed precise localization and redshift determination for FRB 150418 cannot be justified., Keane et al. (2016 Nature 530 453) reported a fading radio transient in the z=0.498 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 (WISE 0716-19; Williams &amp; Berger, arxiv:1602.08434) that they associated with the fast radio burst FRB 150418., Twenty-five years ago, Pringle suggested a boundary-layer origin for jets from YSOs. The jets were driven by a toroidal magnetic field generated by strong shear in the accretion boundary layer. Such a mechanism is clearly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature.Nearly fifteen years ago, we suggested a cartoon of the jet-launching mechanism in protostars in which shear, acting upon MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), generated a tangled, toroidal magnetic field capable of driving a jet. This picture, which is also manifestly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature, relied upon a novel model for MRI-driven MHD turbulence based on a viscoelastic, rather than a viscous, prescription for the turbulent stress. Our hypothesis has some clear similarities to Pringle's mechanism, but it relied upon a large envelope surrounding the central star.An accretion boundary layer has long been recognized as a promising source for protostellar jets in good part because in a standard thin disk, matter loses circa half of all its accretion energy in this layer, but it is problematic to drive a well-collimated outflow from a boundary layer in a thin disk. In this presentation, we argue paradoxically that the \\\"boundary layer\\\" can drive jets when a true boundary layer, like the thin disk, does not exist. This changes the inner boundary condition for viscous angular momentum flux in the disk.The standard argument for a thin boundary layer is, we argue, circular. In high accretion-rate systems, or when the gas cannot cool efficiently, there is no reason to suspect the turbulent viscosity in this boundary layer to be small, and therefore neither is the boundary layer. When the boundary layer becomes larger than the central accretor itself, it is arguably no longer a boundary layer, but rather an envelope. It is still, however, a substantial source of power and toroidal MRI-driven magnetic fields.It is, again, only in relatively hot or high-accretion rate systems in which the boundary layer would be expected to inflate and so disappear. Not coincidentally, it is in such systems, such as Class 0 and Class I protostars, in which we have the strongest evidence for powerful, well-collimated jet outflows., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b. While the first efforts were admittedly optimistic, long-wavelength radio arrays are finally achieving sensitivities comparable to the expected signal, and the pace of investment has been quickening as groups compete to make the first conclusive detection of radio emission from an exoplanet. I describe current survey efforts and their potential payoff: radio observations can yield measurements of otherwise inaccessible quantities such as rotation periods and magnetic moments, the latter being particularly relevant to habitability and star/planet interactions. I argue that the under-construction Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, HERA, will be a particularly powerful instrument in these studies., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b.

Here we report its detection with ALMA at 95 GHz at a mean flux density of 56 \\u00b1 12 \\u03bcJy, making it the first ultracool dwarf detected in the millimeter band, excluding young, disk-bearing objects. We also report flux density measurements from unpublished archival VLA data and new optical monitoring data from the Liverpool Telescope. The ALMA data are consistent with a power-law radio spectrum that extends continuously between centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We argue that the emission is due to the synchrotron process, excluding thermal, free-free, and electron cyclotron maser emission as possible sources. During the interval of the ALMA observation that phases with the maximum of the object\\u2019s optical variability, the flux density is higher at a \\u223c1.8\\u03c3 significance level. These early results show how ALMA opens a new window for studying the magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs, particularly shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanism operating in their immediate surroundings., Ultracool dwarfs (spectral types &gt;M7) were long expected to be magnetically inactive, but concerted X-ray and radio observations (mostly by our group) have led to the discovery of magnetic activity and a characterization of its basic properties. We have recently discovered periodic radio bursts from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS 1047+21, by far the coolest (900 K) substellar object detected in the radio, implying high levels of magnetic activity well into the brown dwarf regime and making it a uniquely compelling target in the challenging search for ultracool X-ray emission. We propose a 40 ks observation with ACIS-S and the VLA that will cover 6 full rotations, place the deepest constraints on X-ray luminosity to date, and may lead to the first detection of X-ray emission from a T dwarf., The relationship between stellar rotation and magnetic activity is important to understand because it has implications for exoplanetary habitability, measuring stellar ages, and the nature of the stellar dynamo. The physics underlying this relationship, however, are far from clear. New rotation period measurements in a large sample of well-characterized, nearby M dwarfs from the MEarth project reach new areas of parameter space and offer an opportunity to gain insight if paired with X-ray observations. We propose 22 objects for study (14 with Chandra, 8 with Swift): 17 with short rotation periods, settling whether \\\"supersaturation\\\" is a genuine phenomenon, and 5 with long rotation periods, contributing to the best assessment to date of dynamo driving in the \\\"unsaturated\\\" regime., Periodic radio bursts from very low mass stars and brown dwarfs simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf 2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5) detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse periodicity; previous Very Large Array (VLA) observations detected quiescent emission a factor of \\u223c100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we present 14 hr of VLA observations of this object that reveal a series of pulses at \\u223c6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of \\u223c1.77 hr and identify it with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10 GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2 M 1047+21 reaches at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly rotating radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both theories and observational data are currently scarce., We present analyses of new optical spectra of three WC9 stars, WR 88, WR 92 and WR 103 to test the suggestion that they exemplify an evolutionary sequence amongst the WC9 stars. The spectrum of WR 88 shows conspicuous lines of N III and N IV, leading to classification as a transitional WN8o/WC9 star. The three stars show a sequence of increasing O II and O III line strengths, confirming and extending earlier studies. The spectra were analysed using CMFGEN models, finding greater abundances of oxygen and carbon in WR 103 than in WR 92 and, especially, in WR 88. Of the three stars, only WR 103 makes circumstellar dust. We suggest that oxygen itself does not enhance this process but that it is its higher carbon abundance that allows WR 103 to make dust., , We present multi-epoch simultaneous radio, optical, H\\u03b1, UV, and X-ray observations of the active, young, low-mass binary NLTT 33370 AB (blended spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable for its extreme levels of magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD) known, and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 \\u00b1 0.0001 and 3.7130 \\u00b1 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components: rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool, equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect nearly continuously. We present a spectral energy distribution of the blended system spanning more than 9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT 33370 AB will affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and temperatures potentially altered by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively. Finally, we suggest spatially resolved observations that could clarify many aspects of this system's nature., Observations of the WC9+OB system WR65 in the infrared show variations of its dust emission consistent with a period near 4.8 yr, suggesting formation in a colliding-wind binary (CWB) having an elliptical orbit. If we adopt the IR maximum as zero phase, the times of X-ray maximum count and minimum extinction to the hard component measured by Oskinova &amp; Hamann fall at phases 0.4-0.5, when the separation of the WC9 and OB stars is greatest. We consider WR65 in the context of other WC8-9+OB stars showing dust emission., Visual photometry of 16 WC8-9 dust-making Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars during 2001-2009 was extracted from the All-Sky Automated Survey All Star Catalogue (ASAS-3) to search for eclipses attributable to extinction by dust formed in clumps in our line of sight. Data for a comparable number of dust-free WC6-9 stars were also examined to help characterize the data set. Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994-2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its `pinwheel' rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the `historic' eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses., Although ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) are now known to generate and dissipate strong magnetic fields, a clear understanding of the underlying dynamo is still lacking. We have performed X-ray and radio observations of seven UCDs in a narrow range of spectral type (M6.5-M9.5) but spanning a wide range of projected rotational velocities (vsin i \\u2248 3-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). We have also analyzed unpublished archival Chandra observations of four additional objects. All of the newly observed targets are detected in the X-ray, while only one is detected in the radio, with the remainder having sensitive upper limits. We present a database of UCDs with both radio and X-ray measurements and consider the data in light of the so-called G\\u00fcdel-Benz relation (GBR) between magnetic activity in these bands. Some UCDs have very bright radio emission and faint X-ray emission compared to what would be expected for rapid rotators, while others show the opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be radio-overluminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at standard rapid-rotator \\\"saturation\\\" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly rotating UCDs may harbor a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field objects are radio-overluminous and X-ray-underluminous, possibly because of a population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously replenished by low-energy reconnection events., Sixty days of Doppler images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) / Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) investigation during the 1996 and 2008 solar minima have been analyzed to show that certain supergranule characteristics (size, size range, and horizontal velocity) exhibit fluctuations of three to five days. Cross-correlating parameters showed a good, positive correlation between supergranulation size and size range, and a moderate, negative correlation between size range and velocity. The size and velocity do exhibit a moderate, negative correlation, but with a small time lag (less than 12 hours). Supergranule sizes during five days of co-temporal data from MDI and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) / Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) exhibit similar fluctuations with a high level of correlation between them. This verifies the solar origin of the fluctuations, which cannot be caused by instrumental artifacts according to these observations. Similar fluctuations are also observed in data simulations that model the evolution of the MDI Doppler pattern over a 60-day period. Correlations between the supergranule size and size range time-series derived from the simulated data are similar to those seen in MDI data. A simple toy-model using cumulative, uncorrelated exponential growth and decay patterns at random emergence times produces a time-series similar to the data simulations. The qualitative similarities between the simulated and the observed time-series suggest that the fluctuations arise from stochastic processes occurring within the solar convection zone. This behavior, propagating to surface manifestations of supergranulation, may assist our understanding of magnetic-field-line advection, evolution, and interaction., Radio observations established early on that some brown dwarfs host kilogauss magnetic fields, despite their low temperatures and the absence of the shearing tachocline that is believed to be key to the solar dynamo. The observed radio emission is often surprisingly bright, exceeding the standard magnetic radio/X-ray (G\\u00fcdel-Benz) relation by as much as five orders of magnitude. This effect is still not satisfactorily explained. In an attempt to improve matters, we have constructed and analyzed a comprehensive database of ultracool dwarfs with both radio and X-ray data, including new observations of seven targets with Chandra and the upgraded VLA. While all of the newly-observed objects were detected in the X-ray, only one was detected in the radio. These new targets are thus consistent with the standard relation, in striking contrast with some previous data. Some pairs of dwarfs with outwardly similar characteristics (spectral type, v sin i) have dramatically different emission properties, with radio/X-ray ratios that differ by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that there is dramatic variance in ultracool magnetic activity. As we also discuss in a companion poster examining the relation between rotation and activity, variation in the topology of the magnetic field may explain the data. This work is supported in part by the NSF REU and DOD ASSURE programs under NSF grant no. 1262851 and by the Smithsonian Institution. We also acknowledge support from the NSF through Grant AST-1008361 and from NASA through Chandra Award Number G02-13007A issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and NASA under contract NAS8-03060., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Co-temporal Doppler images from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) have been analyzed to extract quantitative information about global properties of the spatial and temporal characteristics of solar supergranulation. Preliminary comparisons show that supergranules appear to be smaller and have stronger horizontal velocity flows within HMI data than was measured with MDI. There appears to be no difference in their evolutionary timescales. Supergranule sizes and velocities were analyzed over a ten-day time period at a 15-minute cadence. While the averages of the time-series retain the aforementioned differences, fluctuations of these parameters first observed in MDI data were seen in both MDI and HMI time-series, exhibiting a strong cross-correlation. This verifies that these fluctuations are not instrumental, but are solar in origin. The observed discrepancies between the averaged values from the two sets of data are a consequence of instrument resolution. The lower spatial resolution of MDI results in larger observed structures with lower velocities than is seen in HMI. While these results offer a further constraint on the physical nature of supergranules, they also provide a level of calibration between the two instruments., Recent observations have led to a proposed new paradigm in which fast-rotating lowmass stars host magnetic dynamos that operate in distinct \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\" modes; if true, there are large implications for exoplanets. Coronal X-ray data hint at this effect, but no detailed studies have been done. We propose an 80~ks investigation of four nearby cool dwarfs, two from each dynamo mode. All are bright X-ray emitters. The two dynamo modes are associated with different levels of variability, and XMM-Newton's large collecting area will allow a sensitive search for an X-ray manifestation of this. We will also compare abundances and emission measures using CCD and grating spectra. Our data will test this new paradigm and may provide an important new tool for investigating it., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4(+O?)+O8I: Wolf-Rayet system HD 36402 (= BAT99-38) in the Large Magellanic Cloud shows emission characteristic of heated dust. The dust emission is variable on a time-scale of years, with a period near 4.7 yr, possibly associated with orbital motion of the O8 supergiant and the inner P \\u2243 3.03-d WC4+O binary. The phase of maximum dust emission is close to that of the X-ray minimum, consistent with both processes being tied to colliding wind effects in an elliptical binary orbit. It is evident that Wolf-Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Radio detections of ultracool dwarfs provide insight into their magnetic fields and the dynamos that maintain them, especially at the very bottom of the main sequence, where other activity indicators dramatically weaken. Until recently, radio emission was only detected in the M and L dwarf regimes, but this has changed with the Arecibo detection of rapid polarized flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. Here, we report the detection of quasi-quiescent radio emission from this source at 5.8 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The spectral luminosity is L <SUB>\\u03bd</SUB> = (2.2 \\u00b1 0.7) \\u00d7 10<SUP>12</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>, a factor of ~100 times fainter than the Arecibo flares. Our detection is the lowest luminosity yet achieved for an ultracool dwarf. Although the emission is fully consistent with being steady, unpolarized, and broad band, we find tantalizing hints for variability. We exclude the presence of short-duration flares as seen by Arecibo, although this is not unexpected given estimates of the duty cycle. Follow-up observations of this object will offer the potential to constrain its rotation period, electron density, and the strength and configuration of the magnetic field. Equally important, follow-up observations will address the question of whether the electron cyclotron maser instability, which is thought to produce the flares seen by Arecibo, also operates in the very different parameter regime of the emission we detect, or whether instead this ultracool dwarf exhibits both maser and gyrosynchrotron radiation, potentially originating from substantially different locations., Until recently, it was generally assumed that brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars would not be able to generate and sustain large-scale magnetic fields. Over the past several years, however, observations have shown that some of these ``ultracool dwarfs'' do precisely that. The available evidence does indicate that a substantial evolution in magnetic activity occurs at spectral types M7 and later -- plausibly the onset of the evolution from stellar-type toward planetary-type magnetospheric physics. We discuss the stellar rotation/X-ray activity relationship and its ultracool analogue, which remains poorly-characterized. I show how collected observations are providing strong hints of rotational supersaturation of UCD X-ray activity, which will strongly inform the theoretical understanding of magnetospheres beyond the bottom of the main sequence., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Searches for slow radio transients and variables have generally focused on extragalactic populations, and the basic parameters of Galactic populations remain poorly characterized. We present a large 3 GHz survey performed with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) that aims to improve this situation: ASGARD, the ATA Survey of Galactic Radio Dynamism. ASGARD observations spanned two years with weekly visits to 23 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in two fields in the Galactic plane, totaling 900 hr of integration time on science fields and making it significantly larger than previous efforts. The typical blind unresolved source detection limit was 10 mJy. We describe the observations and data analysis techniques in detail, demonstrating our ability to create accurate wide-field images while effectively modeling and subtracting large-scale radio emission, allowing standard transient-and-variability analysis techniques to be used. We present early results from the analysis of two pointings: one centered on the microquasar Cygnus X-3 and one overlapping the Kepler field of view (l = 76\\u00b0, b = +13.\\u00b05). Our results include images, catalog statistics, completeness functions, variability measurements, and a transient search. Out of 134 sources detected in these pointings, the only compellingly variable one is Cygnus X-3, and no transients are detected. We estimate number counts for potential Galactic radio transients and compare our current limits to previous work and our projection for the fully analyzed ASGARD data set., State-of-the-art radio interferometers are complex systems that unleash torrents of data. If current and planned instruments are to routinely meet their performance goals, standard analysis techniques must be significantly improved, becoming simultaneously more sophisticated, more automatic, and more scalable. While there is no shortage of ideas for next-generation algorithms, there is a shortage of development resources, so it is vital that programming environments for interferometric software allow for rapid, flexible development. We present an open-source software package, miriad-python, that provides access to the MIRIAD interferometric reduction system in the Python programming language. The modular design of MIRIAD and the high productivity and accessibility of Python provide an excellent foundation for rapid development of interferometric software. Several other projects with similar goals exist, and we describe them and compare miriad-python with them in detail. Along with an overview of the package design, we present sample code and applications, including the detection of millisecond astrophysical transients, determination and application of nonstandard calibration parameters, interactive data visualization, and a reduction pipeline using a directed acyclic graph dependency model analogous to that of the traditional UNIX tool make. The key aspects of the miriad-python software project are documented. We find that miriad-python provides an extremely effective environment for prototyping new interferometric software, though certain existing packages provide far more infrastructure for some applications. While equivalent software written in compiled languages can be much faster than Python, there are many situations in which execution time is profitably exchanged for speed of development, code readability, accessibility to nonexpert programmers, quick interlinking with foreign software packages, and other virtues of the Python language., In previous work we argued that jets might not be produced through magnetocentrifugal acceleration, but rather through the toroidal stresses of magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion in a geometrically thick disk or flow. High accretion-rate protostars are among the best candidates for this process because a geometrically thick accretion disk that extends down to the central star is more plausible in this context than in other protostellar systems. These systems are also cleaner objects to study than active galactic nuclei (AGN), microquasars, and the like, which necessarily involve more exotic relativistic physics. <P />Here we present a novel in-depth analysis of the laboratory analog that inspired our work on this topic. This analog consists of the meridional flow around a rotating sphere in a viscoelastic fluid. We examine in detail the fluxes of mass, angular momentum, linear momentum, and energy, and how these depend upon system parameters. We find that the presence of an axial outflow depends critically upon the ratio of the analogous turbulent magnetic stress to turbulent Reynolds stress, which must be roughly equal to or larger than unity to drive an outflow. We also find that the flux of angular momentum can actually be opposed to the flow of matter within the outflow, despite the fact that the outflow is ultimately powered by the radial transport of angular momentum from the central object. In particular we show that, in contrast with magnetocentrifugal acceleration, the angular momentum of the outflow actually decreases even while the material is being axially accelerated. This translates to observational tests in protostellar jets. <P />There are some obvious enormous differences between compressible flow in a gravitational field and incompressible flow in a laboratory. We address this and we and argue why, despite these differences, there is much to learn from this laboratory system., This memo describes the system used to conduct commensal correlator and beamformer observations at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). This system was deployed for ~2 years until the ATA hibernation in 2011 and was responsible for collecting &gt;5 TB of data during thousands of hours of observations. The general system design is presented and the implementation is discussed in detail. I emphasize the rationale for various design decisions and attempt to document a few aspects of ATA operations that might not be obvious to non-insiders. I close with some recommendations from my experience developing the software infrastructure and managing the correlator observations. These include: reuse existing systems; solve, don't avoid, tensions between projects, and share infrastructure; plan to make standalone observations to complement the commensal ones; and be considerate of observatory staff when deploying new and unusual observing modes. The structure of the software codebase is documented., Systematic studies of transient and variable radio emission are a relative novelty. Searches for \\\"slow\\u201d radio transients, sources that vary over timescales of days to months, have so far tended to focus on extragalactic fields. Many Galactic sources, however, vary on these timescales, including X-ray binaries, brown dwarfs, and several objects of unknown nature discovered in previous efforts. We present AGILITE, the ATA Galactic Lightcurve and Transient Experiment, an effort to characterize the population of Galactic radio transients and variables more fully. AGILITE has a large overall footprint (\\u224825 deg), a substantial number of epochs (\\u2248200), and a significant dedication of observatory time (? hr over two years), which make it sensitive to rare objects as well as variability on many timescales. We describe the AGILITE pipeline and the current status of the project. We discuss prospects for the complete survey as well as other applications of the dataset, such as large-scale mapping of extended radio emission in the Galactic Plane., The revolution in digital technology that has had so many obvious effects in recent decades has not spared the field of astronomy. It has led to an enormous improvement in astronomers' ability to study the \\\"time domain,\\\" the expected and unexpected ways in which celestial objects change on timescales ranging from milliseconds to centuries. In the field of radio astronomy a variety of advances have led to a new breed of observatories that are orders of magnitude more efficient at surveying the sky than previous facilities. These new observatories produce data at prodigous rates, however, and require sophisticated analysis to take full advantage of their capabilities. With several major facilities coming online in the next few years, there is an urgent need to prove that terabytes of data can be reliably turned into genuine astrophysical results. This dissertation develops tools and techniques for coping with this challenge and applies them to data obtained with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), a pioneering next-generation radio observatory located in Northern California. The ATA was built from the ground up to be a fast survey instrument, incorporating a suite of the new technologies that figure prominently in the new telescopes. I develop and describe miriad-python, a framework for the rapid development of interferometric analysis software that is used in a variety of ways in my subsequent research. I also present a robust software system for executing multiple observing campaigns cooperatively (\\\"commensally\\\") at the ATA. Data from the ATA are difficult to analyze due to nontraditional features such as a large instantaneous field of view; continuous coverage of a large, interference-prone frequency range; and broadband, movable feeds; I describe and implement several methods for coping with these challenges. This technical work is driven by the needs of a variety of astrophysical applications. I use broadband spectra of starforming galaxies to investigate the \\\"calorimeter\\\" interpretation of their cosmic ray energetics. The data are consistent with a recent hypothesis that the magnetic fields in these galaxies are stronger than traditionally thought. I use the survey capabilities of the ATA to conduct ASGARD, a large survey of the Galactic component of the dynamic radio sky, which has remained poorly-explored due to the limitations of previous obseratories and the technical challenges involved. I discuss in detail the methods used to analyze the data and provide catalogs, maps, completeness functions, and variability statistics. I map extended radio structures in Galactic fields and show how they can be subtracted from the data to simplify the search for transient Galactic sources. I limit the density of transient sources brighter than 10 mJy to be &lt;0.5 deg-2 at 95% confidence. One of the areas of emphasis in this survey was the fascinating system Cygnus X-3, which shows prominent flares across the electromagnetic spectrum. Observations from 2010 May show a bright (1 Jy) radio flare followed by a 4.3sigma gamma-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) \\u223c 1.5 days later. This timing is inconsistent with standard inverse-Compton models, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for the system's high-energy emission., Supergranulation is a well-observed solar phenomenon despite its underlying mechanisms remaining a mystery. Originally considered to arise due to convective motions, alternative mechanisms have been suggested such as the cumulative downdrafts of granules as well as displaying wave-like properties. Supergranule characteristics are well documented, however. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for more than half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) continues to produce Doppler images enabling the continuation of supergranulation studies made with SOHO/MDI, but with superior temporal and spatial resolution. The size-distribution of divergent cellular flows observed on the photosphere now reaches down to granular scales, allowing contemporaneous comparisons between the two flow components. SOHO/MDI Doppler observations made during the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 exhibit fluctuations of supergranule characteristics (global averages of the supergranule size, size-range and horizontal velocity) with periods of 3-5 days. Similar fluctuations have been observed in SDO/HMI Dopplergrams and the high correlation between co-temporal HMI &amp; MDI suggest a solar origin. Their nature has been probed by invoking data simulations that produce realistic Dopplergrams based on MDI data., In 2009, Cygnus X-3 (Cyg X-3) became the first microquasar to be detected in the GeV \\u03b3-ray regime, via the satellites Fermi and AGILE. The addition of this new band to the observational toolbox holds promise for building a more detailed understanding of the relativistic jets of this and other systems. We present a rich data set of radio, hard and soft X-ray, and \\u03b3-ray observations of Cyg X-3 made during a flaring episode in 2010 May. We detect a ~3 day softening and recovery of the X-ray emission, followed almost immediately by a ~1 Jy radio flare at 15 GHz, followed by a 4.3\\u03c3 \\u03b3-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) ~1.5 days later. The radio sampling is sparse, but we use archival data to argue that it is unlikely the \\u03b3-ray flare was followed by any significant unobserved radio flares. In this case, the sequencing of the observed events is difficult to explain in a model in which the \\u03b3-ray emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the companion star's radiation field. Our observations suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsible for \\u03b3-ray emission from Cyg X-3., Supergranulation exhibits both radial and horizontal velocity components within Doppler data. The weak, radial flows drag magnetic field lines to the surface while their strong, divergent, horizontal counterparts advect the field to the edges of the supergranulation cells. Field congregation at supergranule boundaries is observed in magnetic filed images and via Ca II K observations of the chromospheric network. <P />Supergranulation characteristics, such as typical sizes and velocities, have been studied using MDI Doppler data and tracked over 60-days of observations made in 1996 and 2008, relating to periods of solar minimum. Time-series of these characteristics exhibit regular fluctuations on the order of 3-5 days. These time-series are analyzed to extract frequency information and cross-correlated to investigate any temporal link between the characteristics. <P />Whether the fluctuations are an instrumental artifact is studied by comparing contemporaneous time series produced from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. There exists a high correlation between the two time-series showing that the fluctuations are solar in origin., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that manifests itself on the photosphere as a cellular network of around 35 Mm across, with a turnover lifetime of 1 - 2 days. It is strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field. The horizontal, divergent flows within supergranule cells carry local field lines to the cell boundaries, while the rotational properties of supergranule upflows may contribute to the restoration of the poloidal field as part of the dynamo mechanism, which controls the solar cycle. The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended length. It is of interest to study whether the convective phenomena that influence the solar magnetic field during this time differed in character from periods of previous minima. This study investigates three characteristics (velocity components, sizes and lifetimes) of solar supergranulation. Comparisons of these characteristics are made between the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 using MDI Doppler data from 1996 and 2008, respectively. It is found that whereas the lifetimes are equal during both epochs (around 18 h), the sizes are larger in 1996 (35.9 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm) than in 2008 (35.0 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm), while the dominant horizontal velocity flows are weaker (139 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 1996; 141 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 2008). Although numerical differences are seen, they are not conclusive proof of the most recent minimum being inherently unusual., The microquasar Cygnus X-3 is one of the few Galactic sources known to produce relativistic jets and can be one of the brightest radio sources in the Galaxy when flaring. In late 2009 it became the first such system to be seen in the gamma-ray regime with detections by both AGILE and Fermi. We have observed Cyg X-3 at 3 GHz every 5 days for the past six months with the Allen Telescope Array in conjunction with space-based X-ray (INTEGRAL, RXTE) and gamma-ray (Fermi) observations. We present results from both the long-term dataset and intensive observing sessions in which we obtain the radio lightcurve of Cyg X-3 on 10-minute timescales. We focus particularly on a May 2010 minor flare event for which we have coverage in all three bands.The first phase of the ATA was funded through generous grants from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. UC Berkeley, the SETI Institute, the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 0540599), Sun Microsystems, Xilinx, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Papadopoulos, and other corporations and individual donors contributed additional funding., Following the announcement of a 98 GHz flare from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (ATel #3130), we observed it with the <A href=\\\"http://ral.berkeley.edu/ata/\\\">Allen Telescope Array</A> (Welch et al., <A href=\\\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009IEEEP..97.1438W\\\">2009 Proc. IEEE 97 1438</A> for 2.5 hours beginning at 2011 January 28.848 UT (MJD 55589.848), about 4.0 hours after the 98 GHz observations concluded., The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended duration. Among the various fields of study, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. This study continues previous investigations of the characteristics of solar supergranulation, a convection component strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field, namely the time-evolution of the global mean of supergranule cell size, determined from spectral analysis of MDI Dopplergrams from the two previous solar minima. Analyses of the global mean of supergranule sizes show a quasi-oscillatory nature to the evolution of this particular supergranule characteristic. Performing similar analyses on realistic, synthetic Doppler images show similar time-dependent characteristics. We conclude that the observed fluctuations are not observational artifacts, and that an underlying trend exists within the evolution of the supergranulation network., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4 (+O?) +O8I: system HD 36402 (BAT99-38) in the LMC shows emission characteristic of heated dust. Although HD 36402 is close to two luminous YSOs, it is possible to distinguish its emission at wavelengths less than 10 microns. Simple modelling indicates a dust temperature near 800 K and mass of about 1.5 \\u00d7 10^{-7} M_\\u2299 amorphous carbon grains. The dust emission appears to be variable. It is apparent that Wolf Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that assists in the outward transportation of internal energy. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for around half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO is making fresh observations of convection phenomena at a higher cadence and a higher resolution that should make granular features visible. Granulation and supergranulation characteristics can now be compared within the same datasets, which may lead to further understanding of any mutual influences. The temporal and spatial enhancements of HMI will also reduce the noise level within studies of convection so that more detailed studies of their characteristics may be made. We present analyses of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams that provide new estimates of convection cell sizes, lifetimes, and velocity flows, as well as the rotation rates of the convection patterns across the solar disk. We make comparisons with previous data produced by MDI, as well as from data simulations., Solar supergranulation plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. It is clearly detected within SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams, from which a variety of properties may be derived. Techniques that extract spatial, temporal, and kinematic characteristics and provide comparisons for the two most recent solar minima are described. Although supergranule lifetimes are comparable between these minima, their sizes may be slightly smaller during the recent minimum., Visual observations of NSV 19431 and YY Cen spanning the twentyeight years 1980 through 2007 are discussed. These show NSV 19431 is a Mira star of mean period of 298.1 days and visual brightness range of 10.8 to fainter than 15.0. Elements for determining the dates of maximum brightness are JD 2447700 \\u00b1 298.1 days (\\u00b110 days). The O-C diagram shows what appear to be random cycleto-cycle fluctuations with a current mean cycle of 298.1 days, evident from the maximum of JD 2447700 (1989). <P />YY Cen is a Mira star of mean period 371.3 days and brightness range 10.6 to fainter than 15.0. On at least three occasions during this twenty-eight years YY Cen has experienced individual cycles that are significantly longer or shorter than the 371.3-day mean period. Subsequent cycles remain close to the mean period but there is a resulting clear shift in the O-C values. Elements for predicting the dates of maximum brightness are JD2446897 \\u00b1 371.3 days (\\u00b110 days), but they should be treated with some caution due to the random instances of long/short cycles observed thus far and which may prove to be a long term characteristic of YY Cen., With its elongated tail and extended periods of zero activity, the period marking the transition from solar cycle 23 to 24 has seemed peculiar when compared to other minima. Among the various phenomena studied, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. <P />Convection in the Sun plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. The observed phenomena are strongly linked within both observational and physical regimes. <P />This study uses SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams to highlight supergranulation within the line-of-sight velocity data. Suites of analysis methods are applied to time-series of Doppler images to quantitatively describe supergranule flow velocities, spatial scales and temporal lifetimes. <P />The results show similarities in supergranule evolution (1/e lifetimes of 18 hours), while their sizes are smaller and their flows stronger during the 23-24 minimum compared to 22-23. We also present provisional results of statistical analyses performed both within and between the various data sets, some of which tend to show a quasi-oscillatory nature. <P />Future studies to place this work in the wider context of the solar cycle are discussed, as a whole as well as investigations of supergranule characteristics found in various other data such as magnetograms and CaIIK images. Observed hemispheric asymmetries will be presented and how our methods may be applied to further these enquiries., The potential role of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the protostellar jet phenomenon is uncertain but intriguing. A number of works in theory and simulation have explored whether and how the MRI may be important to the processes of jet formation, powering, launching, and collimation. Not all of this work is directly related to protostellar jets, but much of it is. <P />Here, I do not discuss experiments that attempt to reproduce the magnetorotational instability in the laboratory. Rather, I discuss laboratory experiments on meridional flows in viscoelastic fluids and their relationship to MRI-driven jet flows, as I have previously. I argue that these laboratory experiments have much more to tell us about the nature of jets, and jets in protostars in particular. <P />To this end, I discuss briefly how these laboratory analogs of protostellar jets may posses a critical surface analogous to the transonic point in astrophysical jets. I show how the momentum flux and kinetic energy flux in the laboratory experiments may relate to these corresponding fluxes in protostellar jets, and I show how these fluxes depend upon the rotation speed of the central object. I discuss the differing roles of angular momentum transport in the laboratory and in astrophysical jets, and the salient differences between these two systems. <P />Finally, I argue that abandonment of a few common theoretical assumptions regarding the flow conditions in the jet launching region can lead to the hypothesis that a turbulent, thick accretion flow in protostars can produce jets without any magnetorotational acceleration whatsoever. Most importantly, the accretion flow must be hot and geometrically thick. To the extent that this is analogous to a very thick boundary layer, this contradicts the standard argument that accretion boundary layers must be relatively thin when they exist., , Although the relationship between the far-infrared and centimeter-wave radio luminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations in astronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In one interpretation, the \\\"calorimeter model,\\\" rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmic ray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship. Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled synchrotron emission. In 2006, Thompson et al. presented a simple parameterized model to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise even in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization losses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42 element Allen Telescope Array (ATA), we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp 220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadband continuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with high-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal and nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the centimeter-wave regime and cannot be well modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson et al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen, and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model parameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data. Assuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index of p = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to &gt;99% confidence. We describe in detail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistency checks used for broadband spectral observations with the ATA., The galactic center (GC) teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. While slow radio transients have been detected toward the GC both serendipitously and systematically, the characterization of these sources has typically suffered from poor spectral and temporal coverage. The ongoing ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) improves on previous work in both of these domains. In the frequency domain, the AGCTS surveys the GC at 1.43 and 2.01 GHz simultaneously using two correlators of the 42-element Allen Telescope Array (ATA-42). In the temporal domain, AGCTS observations are conducted about four nights a week and have been running for more than six months. During a typical night, 25 square degrees near the galactic plane are observed for a total of 3 hours. The AGCTS dataset will thus have excellent temporal sampling of a large area with spectral index information. We present some early results and discuss our analysis techniques. While the correlator observations proceed, three beamformers are used to conduct a SETI search in the field of view. These commensal observations are discussed in another poster in this session (\\\"The ATA Galactic Center Survey: SETI Observations in 2009\\u201d by P. Backus)., The galactic center teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. The ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) started in May 2009 and is currently observing 20 square degrees of sky for 6 hours every night commensally with SETI observations. The AGCTS will collect 6 months of data operating simultaneously at two frequencies, generating a powerful dataset with spectral index information and uniform temporal coverage and observational parameters. We expect to attain a sensitivity of 1 mJy/bm per hour-long integration and either detect significant numbers of transient events or establish robust upper limits on event rates. We present our observing and analysis techniques as well as preliminary results., Aims: We present a new method for the treatment of the advection of solar supergranulation by giant cells, a large-scale analogue to the observed property of granule advection by supergranules. <BR />Methods: The proposed method is derived from a description of solar convection via spherical harmonics and spectral coefficients, allowing the investigation of the influence of a giant cell component on a realistic supergranule signal. <BR />Results: We show that a supergranule pattern derived from real data, as well as a simplified test signal, can be advected by a giant cell component of various sizes. <BR />Conclusions: The identified behaviour is in analogy to observed supergranulation patterns, including those based on MDI Dopplergrams, which show wavelike supergranulation patterns, even after the removal of the geometric projection effect. Our method is an important step towards the construction of future models involving supergranule flow patterns advected by a giant cell flow. Nevertheless, additional efforts are required to obtain a final verification of giant cells as a separate component of the solar photospheric convection spectrum. <P />New address: <P />NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA., , We present infrared photometry of the episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet system WR19 (LS3), tracking its fading from a third observed dust formation episode in 2007 and strengthening the view that these episodes are periodic (P = 10.1 +/- 0.1y). Radial velocities (RVs) of the O9 component observed between 2001 and 2008 show RV variations consistent with WR19 being a spectroscopic binary of high eccentricity (e = 0.8), having periastron passage in 2007.14, shortly before the phase of dust formation. In this respect, WR19 resembles the archetypical episodic dust-making colliding wind binary system WR140. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, in allocations 67.D-0043, 70.D-0266, 72.D-0070, 73.D-0027, 74.D-0116, 76.D-0029, 78.D-0001, 79.D-0092 and 80.D-0198. <P />E-mail: pmw@roe.ac.uk, Convection in the Sun plays an important role as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. Magnetic field phenomena are thus inextricably linked to the convective process, an example being the gathering of magnetic field lines around supergranule boundaries observed as the chromospheric network. <P />Our research asks to what extent variations in the global magnetic field affect particular characteristics of photospheric convection features, using Dopplergrams derived from SOHO/MDI data during the course of Solar Cycle 23. <P />We look ahead to the higher resolution data that SDO/HMI will provide and any further insight such data may provide., We present high-resolution infrared (2-18 \\u03bcm) images of the archetypal periodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet binary system WR140 (HD 193793) taken between 2001 and 2005, and multi-colour (J - [19.5]) photometry observed between 1989 and 2001. The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical `pinwheel', WR104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be significantly redder in (nbL'-[3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]-[12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf-Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 +/- 8 and 243 +/- 7 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 \\u03bcm) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper motion ~320 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four to five months earlier than those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane., While the correlation between the far infrared (FIR) and radio emission of starforming (SF) galaxies is well-supported observationally, a detailed understanding of this relationship remains elusive. The \\\"calorimeter\\\" model of the FIR-radio correlation requires that relativistic electrons in SF galaxies cool completely before they exit the galactic disk. Thompson et al. (2006) show that breaks in the radio spectra of SF galaxies at GHz frequencies can be used to diagnose whether this condition, in fact, holds. <P />We present Allen Telescope Array (ATA) observations of the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M82 and the extreme starburst galaxy Arp 220. The continuous frequency capability of the ATA enables the construction of spectra with dense sampling at frequencies between 0.5 and 7 GHz. Repeated measurements indicate a typical precision in flux density of better than 10% in an individual scan. Our data allow measurement of variations in the spectral index across the range of frequencies observed. <P />The techniques for obtaining continuous spectra demonstrated herein also have valuable applications to the study of many other targets, including compact symmetric objects, gigahertz-peaked sources, and intra-day variables. The lessons learned from their implementation on the ATA have ramifications for future centimeter-wavelength observatories with continuous frequency coverage such as the Extended Very Large Array and the Square Kilometer Array. <P />This work was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship., While both society and astronomy have evolved greatly over the past fifty years, the academic institutions and incentives that shape our field have remained largely stagnant. As a result, the astronomical community is faced with several major challenges, including: (1) the training that we provide does not align with the skills that future astronomers will need, (2) the postdoctoral phase is becoming increasingly demanding and demoralizing, and (3) our jobs are increasingly unfriendly to families with children. Solving these problems will require conscious engineering of our profession. Fortunately, this Decadal Review offers the opportunity to revise outmoded practices to be more effective and equitable. The highest priority of the Subcommittee on the State of the Profession should be to recommend specific, funded activities that will ensure the field meets the challenges we describe., The recent high-resolution infrared images of the enigmatic cocoon stars in the Quintuplet cluster showing them to have ``pinwheel'' tails, and the deduction that they are colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries, shows how far the study of colliding-wind dust formation has come since the first discovery of heated carbon dust around the classical WC9 star Ve2-45 (WR 104) in the early days of infrared astronomy. The formation of dust is the least expected, and hardest to understand, process attributed to colliding stellar winds, and direct evidence of the connection is only now becoming available. I will review recent work and consider systems showing a range of dust-formation phenomena, including the prototypical epsiodic dust-maker WR 140 and the variable dust-maker WR 70, also long studied by Virpi Niemela and her colleagues., Continuous frequency coverage is an important scientific and technical goal of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We investigate one avenue of reaching this goal with data taken from the high-resolution, broadband correlator of the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). With a total frequency coverage of 0.5 to 11.2 GHz and 1024 channels in a spectral window 100 MHz wide, the ATA is an ideal exploratory instrument for this kind of science. We present observations of calibrators taken over a broad swath of the ATA's frequency range and show how the well-known spectral indices of these sources can be recovered. With this consistency check in hand, a few sample broadband spectra and images of more scientifically interesting targets are presented. Our experiments explore the continuous frequency performance of the ATA antennas, feeds, and receivers and also identify the limitations that radio frequency interference place on our ability to make images. Further observations of this kind at the ATA will yield not only intriguing standalone science results but also valuable knowledge about the developments needed to endow the SKA with a robust continuous frequency capability., In recent years, solar observations have moved from ground-based telescopes to observatories on Earth orbiting satellites, such as SOHO. They provide us with a clear and uninterrupted view of the solar disk. One instrument upon SOHO, the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), has proved fruitful in providing not only important information of the solar photosphere but, in combination with helioseismic methods, a method for probing the solar interior. <P />This dissertation discusses current investigations by myself and my collaborators into surface manifestations of convection phenomena, using Doppler velocity data from MDI and produced from computer simulations. The Doppler data reveal convection cells much larger than the granulation seen easily by optical telescopes. These supergranules' originate deeper within the convection layer than the granules and, like their smaller counterparts, are heavily influential in structuring the magnetic field and subsequently play an important role in controlling aspects of the solar activity cycle. <P />My work presented in this dissertation shows that the supergranulation pattern seems to rotate faster than the surface plasma. It has been suggested that the pattern is driven by wave-like phenomena, but instead we find the reason is a geometric effect with respect to the observer. We further find that supergranules are also responsible for observed corrugation features on the solar surface, which previously had been interpreted as Rossby wave hills. <P />We extend our convection spectrum and Doppler map production simulations to include axisymmetric flows such as differential rotation, which contribute to the evolution of the velocity field. These models assist in understanding how such large-scale surface flows influence the surface motions of supergranules. <P />Lastly, I describe the construction of a numerical experiment to study the influence of a 'giant-cell' velocity field on the supergranule pattern. Such non-axisymmetric flows would further contribute to supergranule advection and the results of such experiments may assist in the observation of these hitherto elusive 'giant-cells'., Geometrically thin accretion disks are azimuthally supersonic, but vertically subsonic. Outflow in well-collimated jets is typically axially supersonic, but radially and azimuthally subsonic in the jet core. Particularly in a thick inner disk or flow, the transition from supersonic azimuthal motion to supersonic axial motion can be made in a flow in which the gas that is ejected is nowhere subsonic. Here, we investigate this possibility within protostellar jet systems. Such a scenario bears some semblance to scramjets, i.e. supersonic combustion ramjets, in which gas flow is nowhere subsonic. Of course, in the case of protostellar jets, the energy source is not combustion but release of gravitational potential energy from accreting gas and/or transfer of mechanical energy from a rotating central object. Nevertheless, there are some dynamical and thermodynamic similarities between scramjets and our protostellar jet outflow scenario, which we explore., We explore the nature of ``hills'' observed on the solar surface that had previously been attributed to Rossby waves. We investigate the solar hills phenomenon by analyzing the output from a synthetic model based solely on the observed solar photospheric convection spectrum. We show that the characteristics of these hills can be explained by the corrugation of the surface produced by the radial flows of the convection. The hills in our simulations are dominated by supergranules, a well-known component of solar convection. Rossby waves have been predicted to exist within the Sun and may play an important role in the dynamics of the solar interior, including the Sun's differential rotation and magnetic dynamo. Our study suggests, however, that the hills observed at the solar limb do not confirm the existence of solar Rossby waves., Visual observations of the neglected Mira variable V407 Sco during the ten-year interval 1997 through 2006 provide a revised period and epoch for maximum brightness. The dates of maximum are represented by the elements JD 2453612 \\u00b1 401.5 (\\u00b1 4 days) \\u00b7 E. The brightness range is from magnitude 10.2 to fainter than 14.5., Observations of the 1.083-\\u03bcm He i line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile, consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (\\u03b8) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10-\\u03bcm) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a `splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., Visual observations of DI Car between 2001 June and 2005 August are plotted according to phase relative to the previously published elements HJD 2438553.70 + 29.210 days. They support the suggestion that DI Car is a regular pulsating star and confirms the variable depth of minimum brightness., Observers have misidentified the semiregular variable T CMa over many years due to the use of charts with insufficient detail. A detailed chart is provided to allow for correct identification and it is also suggested T CMa may be non-variable and should be dropped from observing lists., Previous work on the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation of the solar convective zone (SCZ) generally consists either of semi-analytic approaches in which a simple turbulence model is adopted, or full direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In both <P />instances the inclusion of magnetic fields has been troublesome. Also, <P />both approaches have had difficulty reproducing the known angular velocity profile of the SCZ; this is the Taylor Number Puzzle. <P />I discuss preliminary work in which I incorporate magnetic fields into a viscoelastic turbulence model for the SCZ and apply this to the problem of meridional circulation and angular momentum balance. The principle idea is that turbulent magnetic fields act like long polymers and give the plasma elastic properties. I suggest that such an approach may help solve the Taylor Number Puzzle of the SCZ and bring theoretical predictions for the large-scale motion of the SCZ in line with observations., Visual observations of the little studied Mira variable star SW Hor during the 18-year interval 1986 through 2003 are presented. These provide the basic parameters of its variability, information that had previously been lacking from the catalogue data. An extreme visual magnitude range of 9.9 to fainter than 15 is found and a mean period of 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 days determined. Elements for maximum brightness are JD 2447124 + 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 day, Many detailed observations of jet launching in young stellar objects (YSOs) appear consistent with magnetocentrifugal models of acceleration. This has been interpreted as support for these models. There are other possibilities, however. <P />In previous work, I described how turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may help launch jets. As conceived and formulated, this jet launching mechanism is not magnetocentrifugal. The MRI-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence creates hoop-stresses both on and above the midplane, and I suggested that these confine and collimate the outflow. This is fundamentally different from far-downstream hoop-stress collimation of jets beyond the Alfv\\u00e9n surface such as occurs in traditional magnetocentrifugal jet mechanisms. Indeed, in standard MHD wind theory, the hoop-stress must vanish on the midplane. <P />There now exist substantial observational constraints on several quantities fundamental to jet launching in YSOs, including the ratio of jet mass flux to accretion mass flux, the jet thrust, and the jet angular momentum flux. Here I show that this consistency is not as robust a test of magnetocentrifugal acceleration as might be hoped. <P />In particular, I construct a non-magnetocentrifugal jet model based on MRI-driven turbulent jet confinement and collimation. I show how this model may explain jets in YSOs consistently with the observational constraints, especially in high accretion-rate systems. Finally, I discuss potential observational discriminants between this preliminary model and the magnetocentrifugal class of models., X Muscae is amongst the stars listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as \\\"not studied.\\\" Visual observations by the author during the 5-year interval 1999 through 2003 indicate this is a large amplitude variable star, probably of the Mira type. A visual magnitude range of 12.2 to fainter than 15.0 is found with a mean cycle of 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 days. A preliminary ephemeris for determining maximum brightness is JD 2452085 + 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 E days., Supergranulation is a well established component of solar convection and visible on the solar surface as cellular structures. The convective upflow within a supergranule cell overshoots the equilibrium solar surface creating a corrugated surface. The hills associated with these upflows have been detected as they pass over the solar limb. Their discovery was initially attributed to Rossby waves, arising from r-mode oscillations in the Sun where the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. We analyze these hills by producing an artificial height map derived from the radial component of supergranule Doppler velocity data constructed from the spectral components of a synthetic photospheric convection spectrum. We are able to show that the observed signals leading to the detection of these solar hills can be modeled by applying the same methods that lead to the Rossby wave `discovery', prompting the conclusion that the corrugation has its origins in supergranulation., We present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves of transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previously published by Cooper &amp; Showman. We find that observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC observations at 3.6\\u03bcm of a single secondary eclipse should permit sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper &amp; Showman model of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a similarly robust detection., , We discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin disk limit. These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh criterion, and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative and transport processes in these disks are hydrodynamic in nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the hydrodynamics of laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often experimentally unstable even in the absence of a linear instability. The transition to turbulence in these systems, as well as the large linear transient amplification of initial disturbances, may depend upon the non-self-adjoint nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of perturbations to the background state. We find that small initial perturbations can produce large growth in accretion disks in the shearing sheet approximation with shearing box boundary conditions, despite the absence of any linear instability. Furthermore, the differential operator that propagates initial conditions forward in time is asymptotically close (as a function of Reynolds number) to possessing growing eigenmodes. The similarity to the dynamics of laboratory shear flows is suggestive that accretion disks might be hydrodynamically unstable despite the lack of any known instability mechanism., Rossby waves have been well established as oceanographic and atmospheric features on Earth in which the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. Rossby waves have also been predicted to exist as \\\"r-mode oscillations\\\" on rotating stars and the Sun. Recently, reports have claimed that such phenomena exist as low amplitude, long wavelength features - \\\"hills\\\" - on the surface of the Sun by analyzing spatial and temporal signatures of the solar limb from the MDI instrument on SOHO. We have used simulated data to conduct a similar analysis of the limb and discovered that the reported signatures can be obtained by considering only the supergranule convection pattern., Lightning and related natural electrical discharge phenomena occur on many solar system bodies, most notably the Earth and the gas giants. It has also been suggested that lightning within the protosolar nebula may explain the melt properties of meteoritic chondrules. We consider conditions under which electrical discharge might occur within the interstellar medium. Such discharge would most likely require a gas with a small ionization fraction, such as a diffuse HI region or a molecular cloud. We discuss processes that might create the electric field or emf necessary for electrical breakdown. After considering grain charging rates in turbulent gas, we estimate the magnitude of charge separation by turbulent clustering of charged dust grains, and estimate time scales for charge neutralization by the electron current. We calculate a local heating rate due to an interstellar discharge and use the appropriate cooling rates for each type of region to estimate a temperature history associated with the discharge. Possible chemical and electromagnetic signatures of interstellar lightning are discussed., , Star formation rates on the galactic scale are described phenomenologically by two distinct relationships, as emphasized recently by Elmegreen [Elmegreen, B.G., 2002. ApJ, 577, 206. astro-ph/0207114.]. The first of these is the Schmidt law, which is a power-law relation between the star formation rate SFR and the column density \\u03a3. The other relationship is that there is a cutoff in the gas density below which star formation shuts off. The purpose of this paper is to argue that: (1) these two relationships can be accommodated by a single functional form of the Schmidt law, (2) this functional form is motivated by the hypothesis that star formation is a critical phenomenon, and that as a corollary, (3) the existence of a sharp cutoff may thus be an emergent property of galaxies, as was argued by Seiden [Seiden, P.E.,1983. ApJ, 266, 555.], as opposed to the classical view that this cutoff is due to an instability criterion., P. Williams, Heathcote, New South Wales, reports his visual discovery of a possible nova (mag 10.5) on Apr. 6.565 UT, noting it to be situated 4'.8 southeast of the nearby R CrB-type variable V517 Oph (itself invisible near minimum); Williams gave the position for the new star as R.A. = 17h15m30s, Decl. = -29o09'30\\\" (equinox 2000.0).

Posters., We present results from a spectroscopic search for massive companions to dust-making Galactic WC9 stars as a step to testing the paradigm that dust formation in these systems requires colliding winds to produce over densities. We find evidence for OB companions to the WC9 stars WR 59 and WR 65, but not WR 121 or WR 117. We identify lines of N III-V and possibly N II in the spectrum of WR 88, one of the few Galactic WC9 stars which do not make circumstellar dust, and suggest that WR 88 is a transitional WN--WC9 object and less evolved than the other WC9 stars. On the other hand, the possible identification of a strong emission line at 4176 in the spectrum of WR 117 with Ne I suggests that this star is more evolved than other WC9 stars studied., , We present results from a spectroscopic search for massive companions to dust-making Galactic WC9 stars as a step to testing the paradigm that dust formation in these systems requires colliding winds to produce over densities.

One argument is based upon consideration that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI, in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of direct numerical MHD simulations of collapsars and thick accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself. Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally, I suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here, should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them., , , Results of 18 years observation provide the previously lacking basic catalogue data on the Mira type variable star IY Carinae. A visual magnitude range of 10.1 to fainter then 15.0 and a mean period of 283.90 days are found. An epoch for determining dates of maximum brightness is JD 2447919\\u00b1283.90 days, Oxygen and carbon data from eight stalagmites from northwest South Island are combined to produce composite records of \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O and \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C from 23.4 ka to the present. The chronology is anchored by 43 thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium series ages. Delta <SUP>18</SUP>O values are interpreted as having a first order positive relationship to temperature, but also to be influenced by precipitation in a complex manner. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C is interpreted as responding negatively to increases in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and precipitation amount. Six climatic phases are recognized. After adjustment of 1.2\\u2030 for the ice volume effect, the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record between 23 and 18 ka varies around -3.72\\u2030 compared to the Holocene average of -3.17\\u2030. Late-glacial warming commenced between 18.2 and 17.8 ka and accelerated after 16.7 ka, culminating in a positive excursion between 14.70 and 13.53 ka. This was followed by a significant negative excursion between 13.53 and 11.14 ka of up to 0.55\\u2030 depth that overlapped the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and spanned the Younger Dryas (YD). Positive \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O excursions at 11.14 ka and 6.91-6.47 ka represent the warmest parts of the Holocene. The mid-Holocene from 6 to 2 ka was marked by negative excursions that coincide with increased glacial activity in the South Island. A short positive excursion from 0.71 to 0.57 ka was slightly later than the Medieval Warm Period of Europe. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C values were high until 17.79 ka after which there was an abrupt decrease to 17.19 ka followed by a steady decline to a minimum at 10.97 ka. Then followed a general increase, suggesting a drying trend, to 3.23 ka followed by a further general decline. The abrupt decrease in \\u03b4-values after 17.79 ka probably corresponds to an increase in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and wetness at the end of the Last Glaciation, but the reversal identified in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record from 13.53 to 11.14 ka was not reflected in \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C changes. The lowest \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C values coincided with the early Holocene climatic suboptimum when conditions were relatively wet as well as mild. Major trends in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>c</SUB> record are similar to the Northern Hemisphere, but second order detail is often distinctly different. Consequently, at the millennial scale, a more convincing case can be made for asymmetric climatic response between the two hemispheres rather than synchronicity., P. Williams, Heathcote, N.S.W., reports that this eruptive variable (cf. IAUC 4676, 4966), usually near mag 18, appears to be undergoing an outburst and is near maximum brightness for the first time since 1997, as indicated by his visual magnitude estimates: 2004 Nov. 14.493 UT, [13.5; Dec. 18.497, [13.5; 2005 Jan. 5.509, 14.0; 5.518, 14.0. CCD images obtained by C. Bembrick (Mt. Tarana, N.S.W.; mag V = 14.0) on Jan. 6.5 and by S. Lee (Coonabarabran, N.S.W.) on Jan. 6.6 confirm the current bright state., , We re-examine the Boussinesq hypothesis of an effective turbulent viscosity within the context of simple closure considerations for models of strong magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Reynolds-stress and turbulent Maxwell-stress closure models will necessarily introduce a suite of transport coefficients, all of which are to some degree model-dependent. One of the most important coefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which until recently has been relatively ignored. We discuss this relaxation within the context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in steady high fluid Reynolds-number, high magnetic-Reynolds-number shearing flows. The relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress is not constrained by the shear time scale, in contrast with Reynolds-stress closure models for purely hydrodynamical turbulence. As a result, the anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, even for the case of zero mean-field considered here, cannot be neglected. This shear-generated anisotropy can be interpreted as being due to an effective turbulent elasticity, in analogy to the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity. We claim that this turbulent elasticity should be important for any astrophysical problem in which the turbulent stress in quasi-steady shear has been treated phenomenologically with an effective viscosity., Observations of the 1.083-micron He I line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P-Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (theta) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10 micron) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a 'splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., We report here an example of a series of computer simulations of the formation of disk galaxies, including a standard cold dark matter component, gas, and star formation, which result in objects which closely resemble observed giant galaxies, with a population of long-lived dwarf satellites which contain little or no non-baryonic dark matter., Using a set of 60 Tree-SPH simulations of the formation of an individual galaxy, including star formation physics, we quantitatively assess the numerical accuracy and convergence of these methods. For simulations using 24000 particles in total, the gross structures of the resultant galaxies are reliably resolved., In many SPH simulations of galaxy formation a lower limit is imposed on the kernel radius h equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. It has been found that such a constraint can in some circumstances compromise the spatial resolution to which hydrodynamical quantities are evaluated to the extent that the evolution of the gross features of a numerical galaxies are affected. Such effects can be avoided by allowing h to evolve freely to maintain a roughly constant number of neighbours in SPH summations. Here we focus on how imposing a constraint on h may affect the velocity field., In simulations of galaxy formation that use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the gas component, a lower limit on the value of the kernel smoothing radius h is often imposed, usually equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. In this paper we analyze a series of benchmark hydrodynamics problems and test galaxy formation simulations, aimed at quantifying the effects of imposing such a constraint on h. We have found that in some circumstances, such an approach can severely degrade the accuracy of solutions. In such cases, using large values of h results in an over-smoothed density field, i.e., a decrease in the calculated values of density \\u03c1 and density gradients \\u2207\\u03c1, which unphysically decreases the \\u2207\\u03c1/\\u03c1 part of pressure accelerations. In simulations of galaxy disks, constrained h may also result in unphysical angular momentum transfer, affecting the gross structure of the numerical galaxy. Such an effect occurs because particles in the central regions of the disk sample the velocity field in SPH summations over too large a range in velocities. We demonstrate here that when h is allowed to evolve freely to maintain a constant number of neighbors in SPH summations, such unwanted effects can be avoided and accuracy improved. At the same time, significant savings in computational cost can also be made by using the unconstrained h approach., , We have argued that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in an accretion disk naturally produces hoop-stresses, and that in a geometrically-thick flow these stresses could both drive and collimate an outflow. We based this argument on an analogy of turbulent MHD fluids to viscoelastic fluids, in which azimuthal shear flow creates hoop-stresses that cause a variety of flow phenomena, including the Weissenberg effect in which a fluid climbs a spinning rod. One of the more important differences between the Weissenberg effect and astrophysical jets is the source of power. In our previous analysis, we only considered the power due to the spin-down torque on the central object, and thus found that we could only drive an outflow if the central object were maximally rotating. Here we take into account the energy that is liberated by the accreting matter, and describe a scenario in which this energy couples to the outflow to create a thermodynamic engine., Inertia-gravity waves exist ubiquitously throughout the stratified parts of the atmosphere and ocean. They are generated by local velocity shears, interactions with topography, and as geostrophic (or spontaneous) adjustment radiation. Relatively little is known about the details of their interaction with the large-scale flow, however. We report on a joint model/laboratory study of a flow in which inertia-gravity waves are generated as spontaneous adjustment radiation by an evolving large-scale mode. We show that their subsequent impact upon the large-scale dynamics is generally small. However, near a potential transition from one large-scale mode to another, in a flow which is simultaneously baroclinically-unstable to more than one mode, the inertia-gravity waves may strongly influence the selection of the mode which actually occurs., We discuss turbulent elasticity within the context of the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone (SCZ). The concept of a turbulent elasticity is complementary to the notion of a turbulent viscosity. In the case of turbulent viscosity, the small-scale stochastic component of the turbulent fluid motions behaves like molecules in ordinary viscous fluids to create an effective viscous response of the stress. Likewise, in the case of turbulent elasticity, the small-scale stochastic component of the magnetic field behaves like polymers in solution in viscoelastic fluids to create an effective elastic response of the fluid to stress. This elastic response creates hoop-stresses in azimuthal shear flow. We demonstrate that the hoop-stresses generated by turbulent elasticity induce a component to the meridional flow in the SCZ that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology, that is to say, north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone, for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. In fact it is commonly observed in the secondary flow phenomena of viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory that elastic forces act oppositely to inertial forces. We thus argue that the addition of a turbulent elasticity may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' One additional effect of an effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves, which are essentially Alvf\\u00e9n waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model should thus make testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum., We discuss turbulent magnetic fields and the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone. We demonstrate that the stresses generated by turbulent magnetic fields induce a component to the meridional flow that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology i.e. north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. We thus argue that the inclusion of turbulent Maxwell stresses may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' We demonstrate this by solving for the equilibrium angular momentum balance and meridional circulation using a numerical pseudo-spectral code that we describe. This code includes turbulent magnetic fields through a model that includes an effective turbulent elasticity. An additional effect of this effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves which are essentially Alvfenic waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model in addition to fitting the observed solar rotation profile also thus makes testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum, We propose a viscoelastic model of the Maxwell stresses due to the disorganized magnetic field in MRI-driven MHD turbulence. Viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory are known to produce jet-like structures under the action of a rotating sphere. Here we argue that a similar mechanism may help explain jets in protostellar systems. Such jets would be driven not by large scale organized magnetic fields, but by the mean field stresses of small scale tangled magnetic fields., \",\n          \"The astronomical community is grappling with the increasing volume and complexity of data produced by modern telescopes, due to difficulties in reducing, accessing, analyzing, and combining archives of data. To address this challenge, we propose the establishment of a coordinating body, an \\\"entity,\\\" with the specific mission of enhancing the interoperability, archiving, distribution, and production of both astronomical data and software. This report is the culmination of a workshop held in February 2023 on the Future of Astronomical Data Infrastructure. Attended by 70 scientists and software professionals from ground-based and space-based missions and archives spanning the entire spectrum of astronomical research, the group deliberated on the prevailing state of software and data infrastructure in astronomy, identified pressing issues, and explored potential solutions. In this report, we describe the ecosystem of astronomical data, its existing flaws, and the many gaps, duplication, inconsistencies, barriers to access, drags on productivity, missed opportunities, and risks to the long-term integrity of essential data sets. We also highlight the successes and failures in a set of deep dives into several different illustrative components of the ecosystem, included as an appendix., Answering the pressing astronomical and human questions of our time\\u2014what are the origins of the Universe? how did galaxies, stars, and planets form? is there life elsewhere?\\u2014requires telescope resources beyond what individual universities or private observatories can muster, and they also require much more than the hardware. The most successful modern ground-based astronomical experiments have therefore been those that not only harnessed the resources of large consortia but also maximized their science productivity through early career training, innovative software development, and powerful and user-friendly public data-distribution tools., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as an archetypal mid-scale program, including the technical, scientific, and organizational aspects underpinning its success over the last twenty years. Based on the SDSS experience, we present six recommendations that the funding mechanisms for mid-scale programs should be designed to ensure., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z\\u223c 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z\\u223c 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July., kcorrect fits very restricted spectral energy distribution models to galaxy photometry or spectra in the restframe UV, optical and near-infrared. The main purpose of the fits are for calculating K-corrections. The templates used for the fits may also be interpreted physically, since they are based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar evolution synthesis codes. Thus, for each fit galaxy kcorrect can provide an estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio., Michael Blanton enjoys a history of cosmology focused on large-scale structure in the 'spongy' Universe., We describe a procedure for background subtracting Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of large galaxies on the sky. Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r <SUB>50</SUB> ~ 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data., An essential use of stellar population synthesis methods is to interpret the observations of galaxies, to infer their star-formation and assembly histories. I describe here some of the uses of these techniques over the past few years, primarily in the context of local galaxy redshift surveys. For this purpose, such surveys have both advantages and disadvantages relative to higher signal-to-noise but smaller studies, which I discuss. After discussing general issues, I describe how the substantial model uncertainties impact the analysis of galaxy spectra. Then, I discuss the special case of elliptical galaxies, arguing that investigators have made interesting discoveries even in the absence of perfect (or even good) models. I then describe the desiderata for massive higher redshift surveys and the trade-offs that must be made between cosmological and galaxy-focused science, in qualitative terms., We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types\\u2014spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems\\u2014and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys., In most cosmological theories, the galaxy mass function at small masses is related to the small-scale matter power spectrum. The circular velocity function (closely related to the mass function) is well studied for Local Group dwarfs. However, predictions and measurements are difficult for satellite galaxies because of ram pressure and tidal stripping. By contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by these processes and almost always have 21 cm emission to trace their dynamics. Here we use isolated low-mass dwarf galaxies from the SDSS, with measured 21 cm widths, to test CDM cosmology. We find consistency between the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down to V<SUB>max</SUB> ~ 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our technique yields a direct test of small-scale cosmology that is independent of but weaker than the Ly\\u03b1 forest: warm dark matter particles heavier than 0.5 keV cannot be ruled out (for the case of thermal gravitinos). New, blind H I surveys are expected to uncover a much larger number of isolated low-mass galaxies and will increase the power of our constraints at small scales. Using our sample, we also find that the Tully-Fisher relation for dwarfs is a strong function of environment, and that the baryon fraction is only a weak function of galaxy mass. Together with the strong dependence of gas fraction on environment, these results indicate that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss and the end of star formation are dominated by external, not internal, processes., We propose here for archival research funding to measure the build-up of stellar mass over the last eight billion years, using an unprecedentedly large sample. Measuring the increase of stellar mass in galaxies, and determining its dependence on galaxy type and environment, yields crucial information about the star-formation and merger history of galaxies. This history has been the subject of intense research over the past few years, but has been limited by both systematic effects and by the sizes of the available observational samples. Our PRIMUS survey contains over 200,000 spectroscopic redshifts, measured at 1 percent precision, out to redshift z=1, covering 8 square degrees of SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging. Our sample is flux-limited at i=23 and includes all galaxy types, spanning the red and blue galaxy populations. We have created this sample using a special mode we have developed for the IMACS instrument on the Magellan 6.5m at Las Campanas Observatories: a low dispersion prism in combination with a multi-slit mask. This configuration allows redshift determination of 1 percent accuracy, while also allowing extreme multiplexing to obtain over 2,000 galaxy spectra simultaneously. With the SWIRE optical and infrared imaging in combination with our redshift determinations, we can recover much more accurate estimates of the stellar mass of each galaxy and construct a high signal-to-noise estimate of the stellar mass function over a range of redshifts. These measurements will dramatically improve our current understanding of the build-up of stellar mass, both by decreasing the statistical uncertainty due to sample variance with our massive sample, and by decreasing the systematic uncertainties in stellar masses by using the SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging., We determine what aspects of the density field surrounding galaxies most affect their properties. For Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, we measure the group environment, meaning the host group luminosity and the distance from the group center (hereafter ``groupocentric distance''). For comparison, we measure the surrounding density field on scales ranging from 100 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc to 10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We use the relationship between color and group environment to test the null hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for a residual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. Generally, red galaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales (~100-300 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc) than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure within groups has some importance. At large scales (&gt;1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the actual projected correlation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level with respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly the converse null hypothesis: that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters. These results generally encourage the use of the halo model description of galaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halo mass alone. We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios within the cold dark matter cosmological model., Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections., Most theories of galaxy formation incorporate elements like supernova feedback, ram pressure stripping, and other poorly understood physical effects. Dwarf galaxies, with their shallow potential wells, are the galaxies most sensitive to these processes. Thus, the study of dwarf galaxies may lead to a better understanding of these effects. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, I examine the properties of dwarf satellites of luminous galaxies. By deprojecting the distribution, I determine the three-dimensional radial distribution of satellites around host galaxies. Treating blue (dIrr) and red (dE or dSph) satellites separately, I demonstrate that the trend seen in the Milky Way, that nearby dwarfs are much redder, also holds for other systems. Our results suggest that interaction with a large host is the only process which can end star-formation in dwarfs. I compare these results to theoretical predictions based on semianalytic models., In the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change due to the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, and mergers with other galaxies. Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z~0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z~1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z~1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in <SUP>0.1</SUP>(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ``dry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z~0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z~1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies., We investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, and environments of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We find that (1) the relationship between color and environment persists even to the lowest luminosities we probe (M<SUB>r</SUB>-5log10h~-14) (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlation function has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regions of a given overdensity on small scales (1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the overdensity on large scales (6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies. Of these results, the last has the most immediate application to galaxy formation theory. In particular, it lends support to the notion that a galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matter halo, and not to the larger scale environment. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Interpreting surveys of galaxies which span a range of redshifts requires being able to interpret broad-band observations of galaxies taken through different effective rest-frame bandpasses. All claims of evolution of the galaxy population rely on accurate K-corrections in order to do this. The PI has written widely used software (over 100 registered users and over 100 citations in the literature) for calculating K-corrections in the UV, optical and near-infrared, and proposes to extend this software to self-consistently include the mid and far-infrared. Large public Spitzer surveys like the First Look Survey and SWIRE overlap deep (to redshift unity) public redshift catalogs, and provide an excellent basis for developing these tools. This proposal outlines a plan for developing and testing an appropriate set of templates for fitting SEDs and calculating K-corrections. The tools (in addition to furthering the PI's own work on galaxy evolution) will be publicly released., Dwarf galaxies are simple relative to more luminous galaxies, ideal for testing predictions of cosmology, of star-formation in disks, and of the effect of environment on galaxy properties. To study dwarf galaxies, we have constructed a joint sample of optical, Spitzer, and HI data, including resolved long-slit spectroscopy, showing among other things that these galaxies have extremely low star formation efficiencies. We propose to add archival GALEX data to a joint analysis of dwarf galaxies' optical, infrared, and radio properties to determine their star-formation histories and to better understand galaxy formation in this regime. We will attempt to construct a consistent star-formation history explaining the colors, metallicities, gas contents, and current star-formation rates of dwarf galaxies, and to examine how these properties vary with environment., We examine a sample of low-redshift (10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc&lt;d&lt;150 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) field galaxies including galaxies with luminosities as low as M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh~-12.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2). The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. We present the luminosity function, as well as the broadband properties, of low-luminosity galaxies in this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the slope for M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh&gt;-18. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this sample is \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate that the true low-luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantly low surface brightness, exponential disks, the majority of which are red. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., We examine the relationship between environment and the luminosities, surface brightnesses, colors, and profile shapes of luminous galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For the SDSS sample, galaxy color is the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment. Galaxy color and luminosity-measures of the star formation history-jointly comprise the most predictive pair of properties. At fixed luminosity and color, density is not closely related to surface brightness or to S\\u00e9rsic index-measures of galaxy structure. In the text, we discuss what measurable residual relationships exist, generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity, the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and S\\u00e9rsic indices. In general, these results suggest that the structural properties of galaxies are less closely related to galaxy environment than are their masses and star formation histories. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog. <P />Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics, New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003., We propose to use archival GALEX observations to characterize galaxy spectral energy distributions in the ultraviolet. Our goal is to create a public tool for calculating K-corrections (that is, the transformations between observed fluxes and rest frame fluxes for redshifted sources). This tool will build on and be compatible with widely-used ones we have already made public for the analysis of optical and near-infrared observations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two-micron All Sky Survey. A consistent treatment of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations will simplify data analysis and improve comparison of low-redshift observations of galaxies (typically optical or near-infrared) to high-redshift observations (often in the rest-frame ultraviolet)., We present results on the relationship between the environments, structure, and star-formation history of galaxies, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Measures of the star-formation history, such as color and luminosity, are more closely related to environment than are measures of galaxy structure, such as galaxy concentration and surface brightness. In particular, galaxy concentration does not correlate with environment at fixed color and luminosity. These results suggest that the relationship between density and morphology may be secondary to the relationship between density and star formation history., Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S\\u00e9rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5&lt;M<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;-17.0 mag and 17&lt;\\u03bc<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;24 mag in 1 arcsec<SUP>2</SUP> [the notation <SUP>z</SUP>b represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their rest-frame shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands <SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP>0.1</SUP>z with \\u03bb<SUB>eff</SUB>=(3216,4240,5595,6792,8111\\u00c5), respectively. To estimate the luminosity function, we use a maximum likelihood method that allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, fits for simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates the flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 expressed in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc<SUP>3</SUP> to be (-14.10+/-0.15, -15.18+/-0.03, -15.90+/-0.03, -16.24+/-0.03, -16.56+/-0.02) in (<SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP> 0.1</SUP>z), respectively, for a cosmological model with \\u03a9<SUB>0</SUB>=0.3, \\u03a9<SUB>\\u039b</SUB>=0.7, and h=1 and using SDSS Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using S\\u00e9rsic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the <SUP>0.1</SUP>r band, the best-fit Schechter function to our results has \\u03c6<SUB>*</SUB>=(1.49+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, M<SUB>*</SUB>-5log10h=-20.44+/-0.01, and \\u03b1=-1.05+/-0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in <SUP>0.1</SUP>r is (1.84+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>8</SUP> h L<SUB>0.1<SUB>r,solar</SUB></SUB> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. Our results in the <SUP>0.1</SUP>g band are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (~0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Though the details depend on their favorite galaxy formation theory, astronomers generally expect high redshift galaxies to be more luminous, smaller, bluer, and closer to exponential profiles than to de Vaucouleurs profiles, than are low redshift galaxies. Some of these predictions have been vindicated by observations of the Hubble Deep Fields and other surveys, such as the predominance of the blue population at high redshift. However, in order to distinguish between different galaxy formation theories, all of them require more consistent quantitative measurements than have yet been performed. In particular they require a consistent comparison to high quality low redshift surveys. We propose to perform just such a comparison to optical results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To perform this test carefully, we will analyze the instrumental effects on the comparison of low and high redshift objects, including the differences in resolution, signal-to-noise, rest-frame wavelengths, and background subtraction. By defining consistent measures of color, size and profile shape which are robust to these effects we will best be able to constrain galaxy formation theory. We will release to the community the software we develop and the simulated images we produce., Broadband measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measure different regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 10<SUP>6</SUP> spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55\\\" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92% for all targets, and greater than 99% for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90% (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys., Astrophysicists do not associate galaxies with the massive dark matter halos so easily detected in particle simulations and whose mass function can be predicted by the Press-Schechter formalism and its variants. Instead, they associate galaxies with smaller surviving subhalos whose contents do not fully mix into the larger dark matter halos they exist in. However, these subhalos are as of now difficult to find in simulations. I present a simple description of what the Press-Schechter formalism can say about the clustering of these subhalos, under the restrictive assumption that at fixed subhalo mass, the chance of survival of the subhalo is independent of its larger scale environment. This model predicts a weak dependence of clustering on mass below masses of about 10^12 solar masses, in agreement with observations of a weak dependence of clustering on luminosity at luminosities less than L*. The model is in qualitative agreement with observations that at low luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of color while at high luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of luminosity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

The collective behavior of plasmas that produce these emission signatures is still poorly understood. In order to allow modeling emission signatures from first principles, I construct radiative kinetic plasma simulations of these extreme plasma environments. In this talk I describe applications of these methods to understand the long-standing problem of the generation of coherent radio waves. I show that polar radio emission is directly produced by non-stationary plasma discharges in the polar cap. I also describe how mergers of magnetic islands in the reconnecting current sheet beyond the light cylinder can power high-power giant pulses and nano shots observed from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder., The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma.We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations., A range of long-standing problems in black-hole astrophysics have recently become accessible to detailed investigation by the advent of general-relativistic and radiation methods for particle-based kinetic plasma simulations, as well as GPU-accelerated three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics codes. We propose to use our unique, state-ofthe- art computational tools to study (a) the behavior of black-hole magnetospheres in which plasma is supplied by self-consistent pair creation and radiative signatures of pair discharges near the event horizon; (b) dynamics and radiative output of reconnection-powered flares in magnetically arrested accretion flows; (c) the global evolution of accretion-disk coronae with both spacetime curvature and radiation effects, and (d) X-ray emission powered by radiative magnetic reconnection in the coronae of thin accretion disks. This research has broad relevance to NASA science, as it principally aims to understand X-ray and gamma-ray observations by Chandra, NuSTAR, and Fermi. We expect this work to have a broad impact on the field, from stimulating further technical developments in ever more realistic astrophysical plasma simulations, to aiding the interpretation of observations of individual sources., Accretion flows onto primary targets of the Event Horizon Telescope, M87* and SgrA*, consist of collisionless plasmas. It is yet unknown how microphysical instabilities in these plasmas affect the dynamics of the flow, and how non-thermal particles are produced during observed spectacular multi-wavelength flares. In this talk I will show results of first-principles two-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations which address these fundamental questions. Large separation of microscopic (ion gyroradius) and macroscopic (black hole event horizon) scales in the simulation allows to probe the importance of mirror and firehose instabilities during the quiescent accretion, as well as the dynamics of magnetic reconnection and creation of electron-positron pair plasma in the flaring state., Since pulsars were discovered as emitters of bright coherent radio emission more than half a century ago, the cause of the emission has remained a mystery. In this Letter we demonstrate that coherent radiation can be directly generated in nonstationary pair plasma discharges which are responsible for filling the pulsar magnetosphere with plasma. By means of large-scale two-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations, we show that if pair creation is nonuniform across magnetic field lines, the screening of electric field by freshly produced pair plasma is accompanied by the emission of waves which are electromagnetic in nature. Using localized simulations of the screening process, we identify these waves as superluminal ordinary (O ) modes, which should freely escape from the magnetosphere as the plasma density drops along the wave path. The spectrum of the waves is broadband and the frequency range is comparable to that of observed pulsar radio emission., In this talk I will review the growing evidence of the importance of relativistic magnetic reconnection in powering observed emission from black holes and neutron stars. I will focus on the role of reconnection in accretion flows and jets from black holes and in magnetospheres of pulsars, magnetars and binary neutron stars before the merger., In this Letter we propose that coherent radio emission of the Crab pulsar, other young energetic pulsars, and millisecond pulsars is produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. We carry out global and local 2D kinetic plasma simulations of reconnection to illustrate the coherent emission mechanism. Reconnection in the current sheet beyond the light cylinder proceeds in the very efficient plasmoid-dominated regime, where the current layer gets fragmented into a dynamic chain of plasmoids that undergo successive coalescence. Mergers of sufficiently large plasmoids produce secondary perpendicular current sheets, which are also plasmoid unstable. Collisions of plasmoids with each other and with the upstream magnetic field eject fast magnetosonic waves, which propagate upstream across the background field and successfully escape from the plasma as electromagnetic waves that fall in the radio band. This model successfully explains many important features of the observed radio emission from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder: phase coincidence with the high-energy emission, nanosecond duration (nanoshots), and extreme instantaneous brightness of individual pulses., We perform global particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar magnetospheres, including pair production, ion extraction from the surface, frame-dragging corrections, and high-energy photon emission and propagation. In the case of oblique rotators, the effects of general relativity increase the fraction of the open field lines that support active pair discharge. We find that the plasma density and particle energy flux in the pulsar wind are highly non-uniform with latitude. A significant fraction of the outgoing particle energy flux is carried by energetic ions, which are extracted from the stellar surface. Their energies may extend up to a large fraction of the open field line voltage, making them interesting candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. We show that pulsar gamma-ray radiation is dominated by synchrotron emission, produced by particles that are energized by relativistic magnetic reconnection close to the Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet. In most cases, the calculated light curves contain two strong peaks, which is in general agreement with Fermi observations. The radiative efficiency decreases with increasing pulsar inclination and increasing efficiency of pair production in the current sheet, which explains the observed scatter in L <SUB> \\u03b3 </SUB> versus \\\\dot{E}. We find that the high-frequency cutoff in the spectra is regulated by the pair-loading of the current sheet. Our findings lay the foundation for quantitative interpretation of Fermi observations of gamma-ray pulsars., Radial transport of particles, elements and fluid driven by internal stresses in three-dimensional (3D) astrophysical accretion disks is an important phenomenon, potentially relevant for the outward dust transport in protoplanetary disks, origin of the refractory particles in comets, isotopic equilibration in the Earth-Moon system, etc. To gain better insight into these processes, we explore the dependence of meridional circulation in 3D disks with shear viscosity on their thermal stratification, and demonstrate a strong effect of the latter on the radial flow. Previous locally isothermal studies have normally found a pattern of the radial outflow near the midplane, switching to inflow higher up. Here we show, both analytically and numerically, that a flow that is inward at all altitudes is possible in disks with entropy and temperature steeply increasing with height. Such thermodynamic conditions may be typical in the optically thin, viscously heated accretion disks. Disks in which these conditions do not hold should feature radial outflow near the midplane, as long as their internal stress is provided by the shear viscosity. Our results can also be used for designing hydrodynamical disk simulations with a prescribed pattern of the meridional circulation., The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope greatly increased the number of known pulsars in the gamma-ray band. It was discovered that pulsars often emit a significant fraction of their spin-down energy in gamma-rays, offering a new powerful diagnostic tool of neutron star magnetic field structure. The modeling of gamma-ray data suggests that in order to interpret the observations one needs to understand the field geometry and the plasma state in the emission region. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the magnetospheric structure in the limit of abundant plasma supply, the so-called force-free limit. I used force-free solutions to study the time evolution of the pulsar's obliquity angle. I showed that pulsar rotation and magnetic axes evolve toward alignment as a power-law in time, in broad agreement with observations. Despite the success of the force-free approach for understanding the global field geometry, the location of the emission region and radiation mechanism remained a mystery. To address this from first principles, in this thesis I developed kinetic three dimensional simulations of pulsar magnetospheres which include the physics of plasma production and particle acceleration. I found that the state of the magnetosphere crucially depends on the way charges are introduced into the magnetosphere. In simulations with self-consistent pair production I found several solutions with qualitatively different plasma distribution in the open field line region depending on the inclination of the pulsar. In a surprising finding, I discovered that GR effects help to establish efficient particle acceleration and pair production near the surface of low obliquity pulsars. Finally, I performed GR kinetic simulations of oblique rotators and showed that pulsar high-energy emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation emitted by particles that are energized by magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet. The computed lightcurves and spectra of high-energy emission reproduce the observed morphology of gamma-ray pulsars., Disk accretion at a high rate onto a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star has been suggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (SL)\\u2014a belt-like structure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadily spreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. To assess its basic characteristics, we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for cooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of the SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large-scale acoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the transport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be characterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g., \\u03b1-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have important implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives effective rearrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties of the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and susceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this evolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of the SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only at intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has decelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is dominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. We speculate that this latitudinal nonuniformity of mixing in accreting WDs may be linked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical nova ejecta., It has recently been demonstrated that self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations of low-obliquity pulsar magnetospheres in flat spacetime show weak particle acceleration and no pair production near the poles. We investigate the validity of this conclusion in a more realistic spacetime geometry via general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the aligned pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. We find that the addition of the frame-dragging effect makes the local current density along the magnetic field larger than the Goldreich-Julian value, which leads to unscreened parallel electric fields and the ignition of a pair cascade. When pair production is active, we observe field oscillations in the open field bundle, which could be related to pulsar radio emission. We conclude that general-relativistic effects are essential for the existence of the pulsar mechanism in low-obliquity rotators., We present \\u201cfirst-principles\\u201d relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron pairs. We inject secondary pairs at the locations of primary energetic particles whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with the Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities \\u226440\\u00b0 do not show pair production in the open field line region because the local current density along the magnetic field is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is charge-separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the bulk flow and the size of the pair-producing region increasing with inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet ranges between 20% for the aligned rotator and 3% for the orthogonal rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region, e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our simplified model, such as the effects of curved spacetime or multipolar surface fields., The rotational period of isolated pulsars increases over time due to the extraction of angular momentum by electromagnetic torques. These torques also change the obliquity angle \\u03b1 between the magnetic and rotational axes. Although actual pulsar magnetospheres are plasma filled, the time evolution of \\u03b1 has mostly been studied for vacuum pulsar magnetospheres. In this work, we self-consistently account for the plasma effects for the first time by analysing the results of time-dependent 3D force-free and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of pulsar magnetospheres. We show that if a neutron star is spherically symmetric and is embedded with a dipolar magnetic moment, the pulsar evolves so as to minimize its spin-down luminosity: both vacuum and plasma-filled pulsars evolve towards the aligned configuration (\\u03b1 = 0). However, they approach the alignment in qualitatively different ways. Vacuum pulsars come into alignment exponentially fast, with \\u03b1 \\u221d exp (-t/\\u03c4) and \\u03c4 \\u223c spin-down time-scale. In contrast, we find that plasma-filled pulsars align much more slowly, with \\u03b1 \\u221d (t/\\u03c4)<SUP>-1/2</SUP>. We argue that the slow time evolution of obliquity of plasma-filled pulsars can potentially resolve several observational puzzles, including the origin of normal pulsars with periods of \\u223c1 s, the evidence that oblique pulsars come into alignment over a time-scale of \\u223c10<SUP>7</SUP> yr, and the observed deficit, relative to an isotropic obliquity distribution, of pulsars showing interpulse emission., We perform \\\"first-principles\\\" relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of aligned pulsar magnetosphere. We allow free escape of particles from the surface of a neutron star and continuously populate the magnetosphere with neutral pair plasma to imitate pair production. As pair plasma supply increases, we observe the transition from a charge-separated \\\"electrosphere\\\" solution with trapped plasma and no spin-down to a solution close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with electromagnetically dominated pulsar wind. We calculate the magnetospheric structure, current distribution, and spin-down power of the neutron star. We also discuss particle acceleration in the equatorial current sheet., The eclipsing binary DI Herculis (DI Her) is known to exhibit anomalously slow apsidal precession below the rate predicted by general relativity. Recent measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate that stellar spins in DI Her are almost orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum, which explains the anomalous precession in agreement with the earlier theoretical suggestion by Shakura. However, these measurements yield only projections of the spin-orbit angles onto the sky plane, leaving the spin projection onto our line of sight unconstrained. Here we describe a method for determining the full three-dimensional spin orientation of the binary components relying on the use of the gravity-darkening effect, which is significant for the rapidly rotating stars in DI Her. Gravity darkening gives rise to a nonuniform brightness distribution over the stellar surface, the pattern of which depends on the stellar spin orientation. Using archival photometric data obtained during multiple eclipses over several decades, we are able to constrain the unknown spin angles in DI Her with this method, finding that the spin axes of both stars lie close to the plane of the sky. Our procedure fully accounts for the precession of stellar spins over the long time span of observations.\",\n          \"DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) is the effort to digitize the majority of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) Astronomical Photographic Glass Plate Collection, a set of ~550,000 images of the night sky spanning more than a century of observations. With the support of HCO, DASCH scanning is resuming after a hiatus of more than two years. At the time of the writing of this abstract (late September, 2023), scanning is 96% complete with an estimated ~6 months required to finish. Efforts are underway to make the complete DASCH lightcurve collection available for analysis, enhancing a unique resource for time-domain astrophysics. Work is also ongoing to expose the full richness of the collection in a sophisticated web interface that will interlink the scientific data with archival and historical information, centering the \\\"women astronomical computers\\\" without whose work this irreplaceable scientific asset would not exist. I will report the current status of the scanning effort, DASCH data availability, and the new web portal., In the Jupyter ecosystem, data visualization is usually done with \\\"widgets\\\" created as notebook cell outputs. While this mechanism works well in some circumstances, it is not well-suited to presenting interfaces that are long-lived, interactive, and visually rich. Unlike the traditional Jupyter notebook system, the newer JupyterLab application provides a sophisticated extension infrastructure that raises new design possibilities. Here we present a novel user experience (UX) for interactive data visualization in JupyterLab that is based on an \\\"app\\\" that runs alongside the user's notebooks, rather than widgets that are bound inside them. We have implemented this UX for the AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) visualization tool. JupyterLab's messaging APIs allow the app to smoothly exchange data with multiple computational kernels, allowing users to accomplish tasks that are not possible using the widget framework. A new Jupyter server extension allows the frontend to request data from kernels asynchronously over HTTP, enabling interactive exploration of gigapixel-scale imagery in WWT. While we have developed this UX for WWT, the overall design and the server extension are portable to other applications and have the potential to unlock a variety of new user activities that aren't currently possible in \\\"science platform\\\" interfaces., The principal data set on which this study is based is the 2019 data Release of the NEOWISE-R survey. The wavelengths of the W1 and W2 bands, 3.4 and 4.6\\u03bcm, are well placed for observing T<SUB>g</SUB>~1000-K circumstellar dust emission. The instrument has the sensitivity to cover the fainter and heavily reddened WR stars found in recent IR surveys, e.g. Mauerhan, Van Dyk &amp; Morris (2009PASP..121..591M), Shara et al. (2009AJ....138..402S) but, on the other hand, most of the WR dust emitters found in the earlier studies are too bright for NEOWISE-R, so there is little overlap with the earlier studies. <P />The observations were taken between late 2013 and late 2018. The cadence of the observations makes them most useful for studying variations over short (~1-2d) and long (~1-5yr) time-scales, of which the latter are of interest for the present investigation. <P />The NEOWISE-R Single Exposure Source Data base in the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) data were searched at the positions of all WC stars in V1.22 (http://pacrowther.staff.shef.ac.uk/WRcat/index.php, dated 2019 March) of the Galactic WR Catalogue (Rosslowe &amp; Crowther 2015MNRAS.447.2322R). <P />(19 data files)., Fast empirical models of the broad emission line region (BLR) are a powerful tool to interpret velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) data, estimate the mass of the supermassive black holes, and gain insight into its geometry and kinematics. Much of the effort so far has been devoted to describing the emissivity of one emission line at a time. We present here an alternative approach aimed at describing the underlying BLR gas distribution, by exploiting simple numerical recipes to connect it with emissivity. This approach is a step toward describing multiple emission lines originating from the same gas and allows us to clarify some issues related to the interpretation of RM data. We illustrate this approach-implemented in the code CARAMEL-GAS-using three data sets covering the H\\u03b2 emission line (Mrk 50, Mrk 1511, Arp 151) that have been modeled using the emissivity-based version of the code. As expected, we find differences in the parameters describing the BLR gas and emissivity distribution, but the emissivity-weighted lag measurements and all other model parameters including black hole mass and overall BLR morphology and kinematics are consistent with the previous measurements. We also model the H\\u03b1 emission line for Arp 151 using both the gas- and emissivity-based BLR models. We find ionization stratification in the BLR with H\\u03b1 arising at larger radii than H\\u03b2, while all other model parameters are consistent within the uncertainties., In the solar system, planetary magnetospheres are universally associated with trapped energetic charged particles. This suggests that such magnetospheric systems should be prevalent in the broader universe as well, and that we might be able to probe them with radio astronomical observations. Amidst the ongoing bonanza of exoplanetary discoveries, current observatories are unfortunately not expected to be able to detect Jupiter analogues, let alone terrestrial planets. But it turns out that radio astronomers do detect radio signals from ultracool dwarfs the very smallest stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects that indicate the presence of planet-like magnetospheres that are stable, dipole-dominated, and luminous in gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser emission. I will present radio studies of some of the most spectacular of these radio-active objects, where the extremely rich data require far more sophisticated emission modeling than astronomers typically employ. Because these objects are free-floating and may have masses dozens of times that of Jupiter with rotation periods less than two hours, understanding their radio emission should yield new insights into dynamo physics and the processes driving radiation belt energization., , We present the first ever models of a broad line region (BLR) at the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity using the multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745. The modeled data consist of monthly spectra covering the broad C IV emission line over a 5.3 yr baseline. The models suggest a thick disk BLR that is inclined by ~40\\u00b0 to the observer's line of sight and with an emissivity weighted median radius of ${r}_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={33.0}_{-2.1}^{+2.4}$ light days. The kinematics are dominated by near-circular Keplerian motion with the remainder inflowing. The rest-frame lag one would measure from the models is ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={36.4}_{-1.8}^{+1.8}$ days, which is consistent with measurements based on cross-correlation. We show a possible geometry and transfer function based on the model fits and find that the model-produced velocity-resolved lags are consistent with those from cross-correlation. We measure a black hole mass of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={8.31}_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ , which requires a scale factor of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })={0.20}_{-0.07}^{+0.09}$ . This is the most precise M<SUB>BH</SUB> measurement for any AGN at cosmological distances and it demonstrates that the precision required for BH-host coevolution studies is attainable., Candidates were observed using the Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2), the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI), the OH-Suppressing InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS), and the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) at Keck Observatory; the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2) at the New Technology Telescope; and the Adaptive Optics Module and Goodman Spectrograph at the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. In this campaign, we observed 56 total candidates (Table 1), including three new lenses and one known lens. <P />(1 data file)., The HERA Librarian system keeps track of all the primary data products for the telescope at a given site. The Librarian supports large data volumes and automated data processing capabilities. A web-based application handles human user and automatic requests and interfaces with a backing database and data storage servers. The system supports the long-term data storage of all relevant telescope data, as well as staging data to individual users' directories for processing., We present the first results of a 4.5 yr monitoring campaign of the three bright images of multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745 using the Gemini North Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Nordic Optical Telescope. We take advantage of gravitational time delays to construct light curves surpassing 6 yr in duration in the observed frame and achieve an average spectroscopic cadence of 10 days during the 8 months of visibility per season. Using multiple secondary calibrators and advanced reduction techniques, we achieve percent-level spectrophotometric precision and carry out an unprecedented reverberation mapping analysis, measuring both integrated and velocity-resolved time lags for the C IV emission line. The full line lags the continuum by ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={36.5}_{-3.9}^{+2.9}$ rest-frame days. We combine our measurement with published C IV emission line lags and derive the r<SUB>BLR</SUB> - L relationship ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}(\\\\tau /{\\\\rm{d}}{\\\\rm{a}}{\\\\rm{y}})=(0.99\\\\,\\\\pm 0.07)+(0.48\\\\pm 0.03){\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}[\\\\lambda {L}_{\\\\lambda }(1350\\\\,{\\\\rm{A}}{\\\\rm{A}})/{10}^{44}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{e}}{\\\\rm{r}}{\\\\rm{g}}{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}]$ with 0.30 \\u00b1 0.06 dex intrinsic scatter. The velocity-resolved lags are consistent with circular Keplerian orbits, with ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={86.2}_{-5.0}^{+4.5}$ , ${25}_{-15}^{+11}$ , and ${7.5}_{-3.5}^{+4.2}$ rest-frame days for the core, blue wing, and red wing, respectively. Using \\u03c3<SUB>line</SUB> with the mean spectrum and assuming ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })=0.52\\\\pm 0.26$ , we derive ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })=8.63\\\\pm 0.27$ . Given the quality of the data, this system represents a unique benchmark for calibration of M<SUB>BH</SUB> estimators at high redshift. Future work will present dynamical modeling of the data to constrain the virial factor f and M<SUB>BH</SUB>., There is overwhelming evidence for a link between supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies, yet the physical mechanisms behind the connection are poorly understood. Discerning between possible co-evolutionary scenarios requires precise measurements of BH masses and host properties across cosmic time. BH mass measurements outside the local universe require bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the AGN light overwhelms the light of the host, making host property measurements difficult. Further, BH mass estimates rely on the unresolvable broad emission line region (BLR), and the unknown nature of the BLR limits their precision. <P />In this dissertation, I use a unique combination of gravitational lensing and reverberation mapping techniques to tackle both issues. First, I present a semi-supervised classification approach for identifying rare lensed quasars based solely on photometry in wide-field surveys. Lenses are powerful tools for measuring host properties, but studies are limited by the small sample size, so discovery efforts are crucial. Using this technique, I successfully discovered three new lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with several other candidates awaiting further follow-up. This approach is flexible and can easily be modified to target specific types of lenses as well as lenses in surveys covering different portions of the sky. <P />Next, I use a modeling framework to measure precise BH masses for seven AGNs and infer the structural and kinematic properties of the H\\u03b1 BLR. This nearly doubles the sample size of modeled BLRs, allowing for a correlation analysis between BLR properties and AGN observables that can be used to improve BH mass measurements for all AGNs. I then model H\\u03b1, CIV, and Lya in NGC 5548 using data from 85 Hubble Space Telescope orbits and multiple ground-based telescopes to understand the similarities and differences between the optical and UV BLRs. High-z BH mass measurements rely on UV lines, but our current understanding of the UV BLR is severely lacking, so understanding their connection is critical for decreasing high-z BH mass uncertainties. Finally, I tie the previous projects together with the most precise high-z BH mass measurement to date, using data from a 4.5 year monitoring campaign of a strongly lensed quasar at z = 2.805. Accounting for gravitational time delays, the campaign exceeds 6 years in duration. Understanding the co-evolution of BHs and their hosts will require measurements of this precision at high-z, and this research demonstrates that gravitational lensing makes this level of precision obtainable., We present geometric and dynamical modeling of the broad line region (BLR) for the multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign focused on NGC 5548 in 2014. The data set includes photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical and ultraviolet, covering the H\\u03b2, C IV, and Ly\\u03b1 broad emission lines. We find an extended disk-like H\\u03b2 BLR with a mixture of near-circular and outflowing gas trajectories, while the C IV and Ly\\u03b1 BLRs are much less extended and resemble shell-like structures. There is clear radial structure in the BLR, with C IV the three lines, we make three independent black hole mass measurements, all of which are consistent. Combining these results gives a joint inference of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={7.64}_{-0.18}^{+0.21}$ . We examine the effect of using the V band instead of the UV continuum light curve on the results and find a size difference that is consistent with the measured UV-optical time lag, but the other structural and kinematic parameters remain unchanged, suggesting that the V band is a suitable proxy for the ionizing continuum when exploring the BLR structure and kinematics. Finally, we compare the H\\u03b2 results to similar models of data obtained in 2008 when the active galactic nucleus was at a lower luminosity state. We find that the size of the emitting region increased during this time period, but the geometry and black hole mass remained unchanged, which confirms that the BLR kinematics suitably gauge the gravitational field of the central black hole., Electronic publishing opens the possibility of conveying scientific content using visualisations that are interactive and exploratory, not just static images. The American Astronomical Society, publisher of the Astrophysical Journal and others, has been working to promote the use of \\\"interactive figures\\\" in its journals as part of a broader effort to keep its offerings on the technical forefront. This year, the AAS is launching new tools to ease the creation of interactive figures for two common data types: time series, using a new AAS Timeseries Tool, and sky images, using the AAS WorldWide Telescope. This item gives an overview of these tools and how you can start using them to share your data in a new, rich way., We finalize our tests of the Gaussian mixture model by examining how it classifies known lenses. Of a list of known lenses, 128 lie in the SDSS footprint for which we can obtain colours and calculate membership probabilities (table 2). <P />&gt;From our visual inspection scores, we have 43 objects with score greater than 1.5, after eliminating all contaminants based on the spectroscopic information. These are listed in Table 3 <P />(2 data files)., Photometry at 3.4 and 4.6 {\\u03bc m} of 128 Population I WC type Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and 12 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed in the WISE NEOWISE-R survey was searched for evidence of circumstellar dust emission and its variation. Infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were assembled, making use of archival r, i, Z, and Y photometry to determine reddening and stellar wind levels for the WC stars found in recent IR surveys and lacking optical photometry. From their SEDs, 10 apparently non-variable stars were newly identified as dust makers, including three, WR 102-22, WR 110-10, and WR 124-10, having subtype earlier than WC8-9, the first such stars to show this phenomenon. The 11 stars found to show variable dust emission include six new episodic dust makers, WR 47c, WR 75-11, WR 91-1, WR 122-14, and WR 125-1 in the Galaxy and HD 38030 in the LMC. Of previously known dust makers, NEOWISE-R photometry of WR 19 captured its rise to maximum in 2018 confirming the 10.1-yr period, that of WR 125 the beginning of a new episode of dust formation suggesting a period near 28.3 yr. while that of HD 36402 covered almost a whole period and forced revision of it to 5.1 yr., , We present models of the H\\u03b2-emitting broad-line region (BLR) in seven Seyfert 1 galaxies from the Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2011 sample, drawing inferences on the BLR structure and dynamics as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole. We find that the BLR is generally a thick disk, viewed close to face-on, with preferential emission back toward the ionizing source. The dynamics in our sample range from near-circular elliptical orbits to inflowing or outflowing trajectories. We measure black hole masses of {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({M}<SUB>BH</SUB>}/{M}<SUB>\\u2299 </SUB>)={6.48}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.21</SUP> for PG 1310-108, {7.50}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.25</SUP> for Mrk 50, {7.46}<SUB>-0.21</SUB><SUP>+0.15</SUP> for Mrk 141, {7.58}<SUB>-0.08</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP> for Mrk 279, {7.11}<SUB>-0.17</SUB><SUP>+0.20</SUP> for Mrk 1511, {6.65}<SUB>-0.15</SUB><SUP>+0.27</SUP> for NGC 4593, and {6.94}<SUB>-0.14</SUB><SUP>+0.14</SUP> for Zw 229-015. We use these black hole mass measurements along with cross-correlation time lags and line widths to recover the scale factor f used in traditional reverberation mapping measurements. Combining our results with other studies that use this modeling technique, which brings our sample size to 16, we calculate a scale factor that can be used for measuring black hole masses in other reverberation mapping campaigns. When using the root-mean-square (rms) spectrum and using the line dispersion to measure the line width, we find {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>rms</SUB>,\\u03c3 }) <SUB>pred</SUB> = 0.57 \\u00b1 0.19. Finally, we search for correlations between f and other AGN and BLR parameters and find marginal evidence that f is correlated with M <SUB>BH</SUB> and the BLR inclination angle, but no significant evidence of a correlation with the AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio., Low-frequency radio observations are believed to represent one of the few means of directly probing the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets. However, a half-century of low-frequency planetary observations within the Solar System demonstrate that detailed, physically-motivated magnetospheric models are needed to properly interpret the radio data. I will present recent work in this area focusing on the current state of the art: relatively high-frequency observations of relatively massive objects, which are now understood to have magnetospheres that are largely planetary in nature. I will highlight the key challenges that will arise in future space-based observations of lower-mass objects at lower frequencies., We present the discovery of three quasar lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using two novel photometry-based selection techniques. The J0941+0518 system, with two point sources separated by 5.46 arcsec on either side of a galaxy, has source and lens redshifts 1.54 and 0.343. Images of J2257+2349 show two point sources separated by 1.67 arcsec on either side of an E/S0 galaxy. The extracted spectra show two images of the same quasar at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.10. SDSS J1640+1045 has two quasar spectra at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.70 and fits to the SDSS and Pan-STARRS images confirm the presence of a galaxy between the two point sources. We observed 56 photometrically selected lens candidates in this follow-up campaign, confirming three new lenses, re-discovering one known lens, and ruling out 36 candidates, with 16 still inconclusive. This initial campaign demonstrates the power of purely photometric selection techniques in finding lensed quasars., I discuss three mutually-supportive notions or assumptions regarding jets and accretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the overwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady accreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The third is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading directly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that is simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect. For concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in accretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical work directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic (\\\"viscous\\\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective radiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission problem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar to breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar, permitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow than otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent, tangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an angular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve. Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate but to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then vertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then that jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar jets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven., The lowest mass brown dwarfs can, surprisingly, generate magnetic fields with kilogauss strengths, comparable to those of the most active M dwarfs. However their associated magnetic phenomenology is very different, with strong radio emission that has defied detailed interpretation thus far. I argue that these objects are best understood as scaled-up Jupiters, possessing rotation-dominated magnetospheres, rather than scaled-down stars. I present a new, publicly-available numerical model, \\\"vernon\\\", inspired by ones used to analyze the terrestrial and Jovian magnetospheres. Components include a steady-state Fokker-Planck solver, fast and accurate calculation of full-Stokes synchrotron radiative transfer coefficients, and fully polarized 3D radiative transfer integration. This new model finally makes it possible to relate the data to the detailed physical characteristics of these objects' magnetospheres., The photometric capabilities of the Helioseismic Imager aboard STEREO\\u2019s Ahead spacecraft (HI1A) have allowed the yearly observation of a large number of stars situated near the ecliptic over the past decade. While many reliable stellar variability analyses have been performed, unwanted artifacts may still exist in the data that sometimes manifest as false signals. Between May 22 and July 1, 2016, Kepler\\u2019s K2 mission executed the second part of Guest Observer Campaign 9 to study gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Coincidentally, during approximately two weeks of this campaign, HI1A was directed toward the same field of view, presenting a rare opportunity to compare the contemporaneous observations from both instruments looking at the same set of stars. Utilizing the high sensitivity of Kepler, undesirable artifacts within the observed HI1A photometric signals may be identified and removed. Additionally, intrinsic variations of these field stars, such as those with long periodicities, may be confirmed by calibrating the signals from HI1A with those from Kepler. These stars may subsequently undergo retrospective analyses using the available data from STEREO, which will provide further insights into their variability characteristics., The 2001 discovery of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types of \\u223cM7 and later, revealed that these objects can generate and dissipate powerful magnetic fields. Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures &lt;math xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"&gt; &lt;mo&gt;\\u2272&lt;/mo&gt; \\\\lesssim 1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves., ``Ultracool'' stars and brown dwarfs (cooler than 2700 K, spectral types M7 and later) are now known to be capable of generating and dissipating strong (kG) magnetic fields. Intriguingly, both observations and theory suggest that the dynamo process that drives the magnetic activity of these objects may in fact be bistable, operating in either a ``star-like'' or ``planet-like'' mode. Data that can further test this hypothesis are, however, scarce. In the past year, eight new cold (&lt;1500 K) brown dwarfs have been confirmed to be magnetically active from radio observations. Here we propose Chandra observations to test the bimodality hypothesis by investigating the ratios of their radio and X-ray luminosities, which distinguish the star-like and planet-like modes., We observed the position of the optical counterpart SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC 21529) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 2017 August 19 UT and 2017 August 26 UT. Each observation lasted 20 minutes and was performed using ALMA's Band 3, with spectral windows of 4 GHz bandwidth centered at 91.5 and 103.5 GHz. We have analyzed the data using a custom CASA-based pipeline. At a mean frequency of 97.5 GHz, we detect no emission at the location of the optical transient to a combined 3-sigma limit of 50 microJy. We detect a source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.2 mJy at the location: RA = 13:09:47.696 dec = -23:23:02.31 with a positional uncertainty of ~0.04 arcsec. This is consistent with the optical position of the host galaxy and the position of the radio source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC 21545) and others. We thank the ALMA staff, especially Tony Remijan, for their excellent support., We investigated observations of the candidate optical counterpart to LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 in the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) data archive. The field containing the candidate was observed at both 1.51 GHz (\\\"L band\\\") and 4.89 GHz (\\\"C band\\\") on June 10 and 23, 1984, as part of program AW0110. The on-source integration times were 11.5 and 5.5 minutes, respectively. We obtained images generated by the NRAO's VLA/AIPS data calibration pipeline (L. Sjouwerman, in preparation), which automatically processed the data in 2009. We see no persuasive evidence for radio emission at the location of either the host galaxy or the counterpart candidates. We measure image RMS values of ~180 and ~340 microJy near the candidates in the 1.51 and 4.89 GHz images, respectively. Taking a flux density upper limit of three times the RMS and a luminosity distance of 39.5 Mpc, these values correspond to upper limits on the spectral luminosity of 10^27.0 and 10^27.3 erg/s/Hz at 1.51 and 4.89 GHz. Using the relation between synchrotron emission and star formation rate presented by Yun &amp; Carilli (2002 ApJ 568 88), the implied star formation rate of the candidate host galaxy is less than 0.05 solar masses per year. For comparison, Alexander et al. (LVC GCNs 21545, 21548) report a VLA radio detection of 300 microJy at 9.77 GHz, and Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559) report ATCA radio detections of 600-400 microJy at 8.5--21.2 GHz. These values are consistent with the archival limits., HERA, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, is a long wavelength radio telescope under construction in South Africa. Although HERA's primary science driver is the search for radio signatures of the Epoch of Reionization, its large collecting area, excellent calibratability, and methodical observing scheme make it a world-class tool for time-domain radio astronomy as well. In particlar, the completed HERA array will be sensitive to auroral radio bursts from planets with auroral powers and magnetic field strengths comparable to (factors of a few larger than) those of Jupiter, assuming a fiducial distance of 10 pc. HERA will log thousands of hours monitoring the stellar systems in its sky footprint, including the 40 systems found within this fiducial horizon. In this talk I will describe the current status of HERA and its future prospects for directly detecting exoplanetary magnetospheres., Wide-field photometric surveys enable searches of rare yet interesting objects, such as strongly lensed quasars or quasars with a bright host galaxy. Past searches for lensed quasars based on their optical and near-infrared properties have relied on photometric cuts and spectroscopic preselection (as in the Sloan Quasar Lens Search), or neural networks applied to photometric samples. These methods rely on cuts in morphology and colours, with the risk of losing many interesting objects due to scatter in their population properties, restrictive training sets, systematic uncertainties in catalogue-based magnitudes and survey-to-survey photometric variations. Here, we explore the performance of a Gaussian mixture model to separate point-like quasars, quasars with an extended host and strongly lensed quasars using griz &lt;monospace&gt;psf&lt;/monospace&gt; and &lt;monospace&gt;model&lt;/monospace&gt; magnitudes and WISE W1, W2. The choice of optical magnitudes is due to their presence in all current and upcoming releases of wide-field surveys, whereas UV information is not always available. We then assess the contamination from blue galaxies and the role of additional features such as W3 magnitudes or &lt;monospace&gt;psf-model&lt;/monospace&gt; terms as morphological information. As a demonstration, we conduct a search in a random 10 per cent of the SDSS footprint, and provide the catalogue of the 43 SDSS object with the highest 'lens' score in our selection that survive visual inspection, and are spectroscopically confirmed to host active nuclei. We inspect archival data and find images of 5/43 objects in the Hubble Legacy Archive, including two known lenses. The code and materials are available to facilitate follow-up., pwkit is a collection of miscellaneous astronomical utilities in Python, with an emphasis on radio astronomy, reading and writing various data formats, and convenient command-line utilities. Utilities include basic astronomical calculations, data visualization tools such as mapping arbitrary data to color scales and tracing contours, and data input and output utilities such as streaming output from other programs., Route &amp; Wolszczan (2016) recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 brown dwarf WISEP J112254.7+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of ~17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission possibly with a period of 116 minutes, although our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to confirm it. Our proposed periodicity is typical of other radio-active ultracool dwarfs. The handedness of the circular polarization alternates with time and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Route &amp; Wolszczan recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 dwarf WISEP J112254.73+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of \\u223c17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission. Assuming that the radio emission of this T dwarf is periodically variable on \\u223chour timescales, like other radio-active ultracool dwarfs, we infer a likely period of 116 minutes. However, our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to test this hypothesis. The handedness of the circular polarization switches twice and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Radio studies show that, despite their low temperatures, very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can generate strong magnetic fields and accelerate ~MeV electrons. Strikingly, the resulting phenomenology resembles that of a scaled- up planet more than a scaled-down star, with aurorae and radiation belts thousands of times brighter than those of Jupiter. In both Jupiter and the \\\"ultracool dwarfs,\\\" radio emission traces energetic magnetospheric electrons. In Jupiter, many of these electrons eventually crash into the upper atmosphere, their energy driving haze production and vertical mixing. We do not know how efficiently magnetic energy is deposited in ultracool dwarf atmospheres, or the chemistry that this drives. This deposition leads to FUV emission, however, and we have recently calculated that the most radio-active ultracool dwarf, NLTT33370B, should produce enough FUV to be detectable with Hubble. We propose a 4-hour simultaneous VLA/HST observation to measure the impact of this deposition process. Using a novel VLA sub-arraying tactic, we will leverage well-vetted planetary radiation belt models to obtain an unprecendently detailed view of how electrons migrate through this dwarfs's inner magnetosphere. Hubble will probe their ultimate fate., The z ~ 0.5 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 has been proposed as the host of a radio transient associated with FRB 150418 (Keane et al., 2016 Nature 530 453)., Keane et al. have recently claimed to have obtained the first precise localization for a fast radio burst (FRB) thanks to the identification of a contemporaneous fading slow (\\u223cweek-timescale) radio transient. They use this localization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z\\u2248 0.49 that exhibits no discernible star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient. Therefore the claimed precise localization and redshift determination for FRB 150418 cannot be justified., Keane et al. (2016 Nature 530 453) reported a fading radio transient in the z=0.498 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 (WISE 0716-19; Williams &amp; Berger, arxiv:1602.08434) that they associated with the fast radio burst FRB 150418., Twenty-five years ago, Pringle suggested a boundary-layer origin for jets from YSOs. The jets were driven by a toroidal magnetic field generated by strong shear in the accretion boundary layer. Such a mechanism is clearly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature.Nearly fifteen years ago, we suggested a cartoon of the jet-launching mechanism in protostars in which shear, acting upon MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), generated a tangled, toroidal magnetic field capable of driving a jet. This picture, which is also manifestly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature, relied upon a novel model for MRI-driven MHD turbulence based on a viscoelastic, rather than a viscous, prescription for the turbulent stress. Our hypothesis has some clear similarities to Pringle's mechanism, but it relied upon a large envelope surrounding the central star.An accretion boundary layer has long been recognized as a promising source for protostellar jets in good part because in a standard thin disk, matter loses circa half of all its accretion energy in this layer, but it is problematic to drive a well-collimated outflow from a boundary layer in a thin disk. In this presentation, we argue paradoxically that the \\\"boundary layer\\\" can drive jets when a true boundary layer, like the thin disk, does not exist. This changes the inner boundary condition for viscous angular momentum flux in the disk.The standard argument for a thin boundary layer is, we argue, circular. In high accretion-rate systems, or when the gas cannot cool efficiently, there is no reason to suspect the turbulent viscosity in this boundary layer to be small, and therefore neither is the boundary layer. When the boundary layer becomes larger than the central accretor itself, it is arguably no longer a boundary layer, but rather an envelope. It is still, however, a substantial source of power and toroidal MRI-driven magnetic fields.It is, again, only in relatively hot or high-accretion rate systems in which the boundary layer would be expected to inflate and so disappear. Not coincidentally, it is in such systems, such as Class 0 and Class I protostars, in which we have the strongest evidence for powerful, well-collimated jet outflows., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b. While the first efforts were admittedly optimistic, long-wavelength radio arrays are finally achieving sensitivities comparable to the expected signal, and the pace of investment has been quickening as groups compete to make the first conclusive detection of radio emission from an exoplanet. I describe current survey efforts and their potential payoff: radio observations can yield measurements of otherwise inaccessible quantities such as rotation periods and magnetic moments, the latter being particularly relevant to habitability and star/planet interactions. I argue that the under-construction Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, HERA, will be a particularly powerful instrument in these studies., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b.

Here we report its detection with ALMA at 95 GHz at a mean flux density of 56 \\u00b1 12 \\u03bcJy, making it the first ultracool dwarf detected in the millimeter band, excluding young, disk-bearing objects. We also report flux density measurements from unpublished archival VLA data and new optical monitoring data from the Liverpool Telescope. The ALMA data are consistent with a power-law radio spectrum that extends continuously between centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We argue that the emission is due to the synchrotron process, excluding thermal, free-free, and electron cyclotron maser emission as possible sources. During the interval of the ALMA observation that phases with the maximum of the object\\u2019s optical variability, the flux density is higher at a \\u223c1.8\\u03c3 significance level. These early results show how ALMA opens a new window for studying the magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs, particularly shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanism operating in their immediate surroundings., Ultracool dwarfs (spectral types &gt;M7) were long expected to be magnetically inactive, but concerted X-ray and radio observations (mostly by our group) have led to the discovery of magnetic activity and a characterization of its basic properties. We have recently discovered periodic radio bursts from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS 1047+21, by far the coolest (900 K) substellar object detected in the radio, implying high levels of magnetic activity well into the brown dwarf regime and making it a uniquely compelling target in the challenging search for ultracool X-ray emission. We propose a 40 ks observation with ACIS-S and the VLA that will cover 6 full rotations, place the deepest constraints on X-ray luminosity to date, and may lead to the first detection of X-ray emission from a T dwarf., The relationship between stellar rotation and magnetic activity is important to understand because it has implications for exoplanetary habitability, measuring stellar ages, and the nature of the stellar dynamo. The physics underlying this relationship, however, are far from clear. New rotation period measurements in a large sample of well-characterized, nearby M dwarfs from the MEarth project reach new areas of parameter space and offer an opportunity to gain insight if paired with X-ray observations. We propose 22 objects for study (14 with Chandra, 8 with Swift): 17 with short rotation periods, settling whether \\\"supersaturation\\\" is a genuine phenomenon, and 5 with long rotation periods, contributing to the best assessment to date of dynamo driving in the \\\"unsaturated\\\" regime., Periodic radio bursts from very low mass stars and brown dwarfs simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf 2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5) detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse periodicity; previous Very Large Array (VLA) observations detected quiescent emission a factor of \\u223c100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we present 14 hr of VLA observations of this object that reveal a series of pulses at \\u223c6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of \\u223c1.77 hr and identify it with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10 GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2 M 1047+21 reaches at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly rotating radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both theories and observational data are currently scarce., We present analyses of new optical spectra of three WC9 stars, WR 88, WR 92 and WR 103 to test the suggestion that they exemplify an evolutionary sequence amongst the WC9 stars. The spectrum of WR 88 shows conspicuous lines of N III and N IV, leading to classification as a transitional WN8o/WC9 star. The three stars show a sequence of increasing O II and O III line strengths, confirming and extending earlier studies. The spectra were analysed using CMFGEN models, finding greater abundances of oxygen and carbon in WR 103 than in WR 92 and, especially, in WR 88. Of the three stars, only WR 103 makes circumstellar dust. We suggest that oxygen itself does not enhance this process but that it is its higher carbon abundance that allows WR 103 to make dust., , We present multi-epoch simultaneous radio, optical, H\\u03b1, UV, and X-ray observations of the active, young, low-mass binary NLTT 33370 AB (blended spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable for its extreme levels of magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD) known, and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 \\u00b1 0.0001 and 3.7130 \\u00b1 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components: rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool, equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect nearly continuously. We present a spectral energy distribution of the blended system spanning more than 9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT 33370 AB will affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and temperatures potentially altered by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively. Finally, we suggest spatially resolved observations that could clarify many aspects of this system's nature., Observations of the WC9+OB system WR65 in the infrared show variations of its dust emission consistent with a period near 4.8 yr, suggesting formation in a colliding-wind binary (CWB) having an elliptical orbit. If we adopt the IR maximum as zero phase, the times of X-ray maximum count and minimum extinction to the hard component measured by Oskinova &amp; Hamann fall at phases 0.4-0.5, when the separation of the WC9 and OB stars is greatest. We consider WR65 in the context of other WC8-9+OB stars showing dust emission., Visual photometry of 16 WC8-9 dust-making Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars during 2001-2009 was extracted from the All-Sky Automated Survey All Star Catalogue (ASAS-3) to search for eclipses attributable to extinction by dust formed in clumps in our line of sight. Data for a comparable number of dust-free WC6-9 stars were also examined to help characterize the data set. Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994-2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its `pinwheel' rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the `historic' eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses., Although ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) are now known to generate and dissipate strong magnetic fields, a clear understanding of the underlying dynamo is still lacking. We have performed X-ray and radio observations of seven UCDs in a narrow range of spectral type (M6.5-M9.5) but spanning a wide range of projected rotational velocities (vsin i \\u2248 3-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). We have also analyzed unpublished archival Chandra observations of four additional objects. All of the newly observed targets are detected in the X-ray, while only one is detected in the radio, with the remainder having sensitive upper limits. We present a database of UCDs with both radio and X-ray measurements and consider the data in light of the so-called G\\u00fcdel-Benz relation (GBR) between magnetic activity in these bands. Some UCDs have very bright radio emission and faint X-ray emission compared to what would be expected for rapid rotators, while others show the opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be radio-overluminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at standard rapid-rotator \\\"saturation\\\" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly rotating UCDs may harbor a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field objects are radio-overluminous and X-ray-underluminous, possibly because of a population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously replenished by low-energy reconnection events., Sixty days of Doppler images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) / Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) investigation during the 1996 and 2008 solar minima have been analyzed to show that certain supergranule characteristics (size, size range, and horizontal velocity) exhibit fluctuations of three to five days. Cross-correlating parameters showed a good, positive correlation between supergranulation size and size range, and a moderate, negative correlation between size range and velocity. The size and velocity do exhibit a moderate, negative correlation, but with a small time lag (less than 12 hours). Supergranule sizes during five days of co-temporal data from MDI and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) / Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) exhibit similar fluctuations with a high level of correlation between them. This verifies the solar origin of the fluctuations, which cannot be caused by instrumental artifacts according to these observations. Similar fluctuations are also observed in data simulations that model the evolution of the MDI Doppler pattern over a 60-day period. Correlations between the supergranule size and size range time-series derived from the simulated data are similar to those seen in MDI data. A simple toy-model using cumulative, uncorrelated exponential growth and decay patterns at random emergence times produces a time-series similar to the data simulations. The qualitative similarities between the simulated and the observed time-series suggest that the fluctuations arise from stochastic processes occurring within the solar convection zone. This behavior, propagating to surface manifestations of supergranulation, may assist our understanding of magnetic-field-line advection, evolution, and interaction., Radio observations established early on that some brown dwarfs host kilogauss magnetic fields, despite their low temperatures and the absence of the shearing tachocline that is believed to be key to the solar dynamo. The observed radio emission is often surprisingly bright, exceeding the standard magnetic radio/X-ray (G\\u00fcdel-Benz) relation by as much as five orders of magnitude. This effect is still not satisfactorily explained. In an attempt to improve matters, we have constructed and analyzed a comprehensive database of ultracool dwarfs with both radio and X-ray data, including new observations of seven targets with Chandra and the upgraded VLA. While all of the newly-observed objects were detected in the X-ray, only one was detected in the radio. These new targets are thus consistent with the standard relation, in striking contrast with some previous data. Some pairs of dwarfs with outwardly similar characteristics (spectral type, v sin i) have dramatically different emission properties, with radio/X-ray ratios that differ by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that there is dramatic variance in ultracool magnetic activity. As we also discuss in a companion poster examining the relation between rotation and activity, variation in the topology of the magnetic field may explain the data. This work is supported in part by the NSF REU and DOD ASSURE programs under NSF grant no. 1262851 and by the Smithsonian Institution. We also acknowledge support from the NSF through Grant AST-1008361 and from NASA through Chandra Award Number G02-13007A issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and NASA under contract NAS8-03060., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Co-temporal Doppler images from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) have been analyzed to extract quantitative information about global properties of the spatial and temporal characteristics of solar supergranulation. Preliminary comparisons show that supergranules appear to be smaller and have stronger horizontal velocity flows within HMI data than was measured with MDI. There appears to be no difference in their evolutionary timescales. Supergranule sizes and velocities were analyzed over a ten-day time period at a 15-minute cadence. While the averages of the time-series retain the aforementioned differences, fluctuations of these parameters first observed in MDI data were seen in both MDI and HMI time-series, exhibiting a strong cross-correlation. This verifies that these fluctuations are not instrumental, but are solar in origin. The observed discrepancies between the averaged values from the two sets of data are a consequence of instrument resolution. The lower spatial resolution of MDI results in larger observed structures with lower velocities than is seen in HMI. While these results offer a further constraint on the physical nature of supergranules, they also provide a level of calibration between the two instruments., Recent observations have led to a proposed new paradigm in which fast-rotating lowmass stars host magnetic dynamos that operate in distinct \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\" modes; if true, there are large implications for exoplanets. Coronal X-ray data hint at this effect, but no detailed studies have been done. We propose an 80~ks investigation of four nearby cool dwarfs, two from each dynamo mode. All are bright X-ray emitters. The two dynamo modes are associated with different levels of variability, and XMM-Newton's large collecting area will allow a sensitive search for an X-ray manifestation of this. We will also compare abundances and emission measures using CCD and grating spectra. Our data will test this new paradigm and may provide an important new tool for investigating it., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4(+O?)+O8I: Wolf-Rayet system HD 36402 (= BAT99-38) in the Large Magellanic Cloud shows emission characteristic of heated dust. The dust emission is variable on a time-scale of years, with a period near 4.7 yr, possibly associated with orbital motion of the O8 supergiant and the inner P \\u2243 3.03-d WC4+O binary. The phase of maximum dust emission is close to that of the X-ray minimum, consistent with both processes being tied to colliding wind effects in an elliptical binary orbit. It is evident that Wolf-Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Radio detections of ultracool dwarfs provide insight into their magnetic fields and the dynamos that maintain them, especially at the very bottom of the main sequence, where other activity indicators dramatically weaken. Until recently, radio emission was only detected in the M and L dwarf regimes, but this has changed with the Arecibo detection of rapid polarized flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. Here, we report the detection of quasi-quiescent radio emission from this source at 5.8 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The spectral luminosity is L <SUB>\\u03bd</SUB> = (2.2 \\u00b1 0.7) \\u00d7 10<SUP>12</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>, a factor of ~100 times fainter than the Arecibo flares. Our detection is the lowest luminosity yet achieved for an ultracool dwarf. Although the emission is fully consistent with being steady, unpolarized, and broad band, we find tantalizing hints for variability. We exclude the presence of short-duration flares as seen by Arecibo, although this is not unexpected given estimates of the duty cycle. Follow-up observations of this object will offer the potential to constrain its rotation period, electron density, and the strength and configuration of the magnetic field. Equally important, follow-up observations will address the question of whether the electron cyclotron maser instability, which is thought to produce the flares seen by Arecibo, also operates in the very different parameter regime of the emission we detect, or whether instead this ultracool dwarf exhibits both maser and gyrosynchrotron radiation, potentially originating from substantially different locations., Until recently, it was generally assumed that brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars would not be able to generate and sustain large-scale magnetic fields. Over the past several years, however, observations have shown that some of these ``ultracool dwarfs'' do precisely that. The available evidence does indicate that a substantial evolution in magnetic activity occurs at spectral types M7 and later -- plausibly the onset of the evolution from stellar-type toward planetary-type magnetospheric physics. We discuss the stellar rotation/X-ray activity relationship and its ultracool analogue, which remains poorly-characterized. I show how collected observations are providing strong hints of rotational supersaturation of UCD X-ray activity, which will strongly inform the theoretical understanding of magnetospheres beyond the bottom of the main sequence., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Searches for slow radio transients and variables have generally focused on extragalactic populations, and the basic parameters of Galactic populations remain poorly characterized. We present a large 3 GHz survey performed with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) that aims to improve this situation: ASGARD, the ATA Survey of Galactic Radio Dynamism. ASGARD observations spanned two years with weekly visits to 23 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in two fields in the Galactic plane, totaling 900 hr of integration time on science fields and making it significantly larger than previous efforts. The typical blind unresolved source detection limit was 10 mJy. We describe the observations and data analysis techniques in detail, demonstrating our ability to create accurate wide-field images while effectively modeling and subtracting large-scale radio emission, allowing standard transient-and-variability analysis techniques to be used. We present early results from the analysis of two pointings: one centered on the microquasar Cygnus X-3 and one overlapping the Kepler field of view (l = 76\\u00b0, b = +13.\\u00b05). Our results include images, catalog statistics, completeness functions, variability measurements, and a transient search. Out of 134 sources detected in these pointings, the only compellingly variable one is Cygnus X-3, and no transients are detected. We estimate number counts for potential Galactic radio transients and compare our current limits to previous work and our projection for the fully analyzed ASGARD data set., State-of-the-art radio interferometers are complex systems that unleash torrents of data. If current and planned instruments are to routinely meet their performance goals, standard analysis techniques must be significantly improved, becoming simultaneously more sophisticated, more automatic, and more scalable. While there is no shortage of ideas for next-generation algorithms, there is a shortage of development resources, so it is vital that programming environments for interferometric software allow for rapid, flexible development. We present an open-source software package, miriad-python, that provides access to the MIRIAD interferometric reduction system in the Python programming language. The modular design of MIRIAD and the high productivity and accessibility of Python provide an excellent foundation for rapid development of interferometric software. Several other projects with similar goals exist, and we describe them and compare miriad-python with them in detail. Along with an overview of the package design, we present sample code and applications, including the detection of millisecond astrophysical transients, determination and application of nonstandard calibration parameters, interactive data visualization, and a reduction pipeline using a directed acyclic graph dependency model analogous to that of the traditional UNIX tool make. The key aspects of the miriad-python software project are documented. We find that miriad-python provides an extremely effective environment for prototyping new interferometric software, though certain existing packages provide far more infrastructure for some applications. While equivalent software written in compiled languages can be much faster than Python, there are many situations in which execution time is profitably exchanged for speed of development, code readability, accessibility to nonexpert programmers, quick interlinking with foreign software packages, and other virtues of the Python language., In previous work we argued that jets might not be produced through magnetocentrifugal acceleration, but rather through the toroidal stresses of magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion in a geometrically thick disk or flow. High accretion-rate protostars are among the best candidates for this process because a geometrically thick accretion disk that extends down to the central star is more plausible in this context than in other protostellar systems. These systems are also cleaner objects to study than active galactic nuclei (AGN), microquasars, and the like, which necessarily involve more exotic relativistic physics. <P />Here we present a novel in-depth analysis of the laboratory analog that inspired our work on this topic. This analog consists of the meridional flow around a rotating sphere in a viscoelastic fluid. We examine in detail the fluxes of mass, angular momentum, linear momentum, and energy, and how these depend upon system parameters. We find that the presence of an axial outflow depends critically upon the ratio of the analogous turbulent magnetic stress to turbulent Reynolds stress, which must be roughly equal to or larger than unity to drive an outflow. We also find that the flux of angular momentum can actually be opposed to the flow of matter within the outflow, despite the fact that the outflow is ultimately powered by the radial transport of angular momentum from the central object. In particular we show that, in contrast with magnetocentrifugal acceleration, the angular momentum of the outflow actually decreases even while the material is being axially accelerated. This translates to observational tests in protostellar jets. <P />There are some obvious enormous differences between compressible flow in a gravitational field and incompressible flow in a laboratory. We address this and we and argue why, despite these differences, there is much to learn from this laboratory system., This memo describes the system used to conduct commensal correlator and beamformer observations at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). This system was deployed for ~2 years until the ATA hibernation in 2011 and was responsible for collecting &gt;5 TB of data during thousands of hours of observations. The general system design is presented and the implementation is discussed in detail. I emphasize the rationale for various design decisions and attempt to document a few aspects of ATA operations that might not be obvious to non-insiders. I close with some recommendations from my experience developing the software infrastructure and managing the correlator observations. These include: reuse existing systems; solve, don't avoid, tensions between projects, and share infrastructure; plan to make standalone observations to complement the commensal ones; and be considerate of observatory staff when deploying new and unusual observing modes. The structure of the software codebase is documented., Systematic studies of transient and variable radio emission are a relative novelty. Searches for \\\"slow\\u201d radio transients, sources that vary over timescales of days to months, have so far tended to focus on extragalactic fields. Many Galactic sources, however, vary on these timescales, including X-ray binaries, brown dwarfs, and several objects of unknown nature discovered in previous efforts. We present AGILITE, the ATA Galactic Lightcurve and Transient Experiment, an effort to characterize the population of Galactic radio transients and variables more fully. AGILITE has a large overall footprint (\\u224825 deg), a substantial number of epochs (\\u2248200), and a significant dedication of observatory time (? hr over two years), which make it sensitive to rare objects as well as variability on many timescales. We describe the AGILITE pipeline and the current status of the project. We discuss prospects for the complete survey as well as other applications of the dataset, such as large-scale mapping of extended radio emission in the Galactic Plane., The revolution in digital technology that has had so many obvious effects in recent decades has not spared the field of astronomy. It has led to an enormous improvement in astronomers' ability to study the \\\"time domain,\\\" the expected and unexpected ways in which celestial objects change on timescales ranging from milliseconds to centuries. In the field of radio astronomy a variety of advances have led to a new breed of observatories that are orders of magnitude more efficient at surveying the sky than previous facilities. These new observatories produce data at prodigous rates, however, and require sophisticated analysis to take full advantage of their capabilities. With several major facilities coming online in the next few years, there is an urgent need to prove that terabytes of data can be reliably turned into genuine astrophysical results. This dissertation develops tools and techniques for coping with this challenge and applies them to data obtained with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), a pioneering next-generation radio observatory located in Northern California. The ATA was built from the ground up to be a fast survey instrument, incorporating a suite of the new technologies that figure prominently in the new telescopes. I develop and describe miriad-python, a framework for the rapid development of interferometric analysis software that is used in a variety of ways in my subsequent research. I also present a robust software system for executing multiple observing campaigns cooperatively (\\\"commensally\\\") at the ATA. Data from the ATA are difficult to analyze due to nontraditional features such as a large instantaneous field of view; continuous coverage of a large, interference-prone frequency range; and broadband, movable feeds; I describe and implement several methods for coping with these challenges. This technical work is driven by the needs of a variety of astrophysical applications. I use broadband spectra of starforming galaxies to investigate the \\\"calorimeter\\\" interpretation of their cosmic ray energetics. The data are consistent with a recent hypothesis that the magnetic fields in these galaxies are stronger than traditionally thought. I use the survey capabilities of the ATA to conduct ASGARD, a large survey of the Galactic component of the dynamic radio sky, which has remained poorly-explored due to the limitations of previous obseratories and the technical challenges involved. I discuss in detail the methods used to analyze the data and provide catalogs, maps, completeness functions, and variability statistics. I map extended radio structures in Galactic fields and show how they can be subtracted from the data to simplify the search for transient Galactic sources. I limit the density of transient sources brighter than 10 mJy to be &lt;0.5 deg-2 at 95% confidence. One of the areas of emphasis in this survey was the fascinating system Cygnus X-3, which shows prominent flares across the electromagnetic spectrum. Observations from 2010 May show a bright (1 Jy) radio flare followed by a 4.3sigma gamma-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) \\u223c 1.5 days later. This timing is inconsistent with standard inverse-Compton models, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for the system's high-energy emission., Supergranulation is a well-observed solar phenomenon despite its underlying mechanisms remaining a mystery. Originally considered to arise due to convective motions, alternative mechanisms have been suggested such as the cumulative downdrafts of granules as well as displaying wave-like properties. Supergranule characteristics are well documented, however. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for more than half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) continues to produce Doppler images enabling the continuation of supergranulation studies made with SOHO/MDI, but with superior temporal and spatial resolution. The size-distribution of divergent cellular flows observed on the photosphere now reaches down to granular scales, allowing contemporaneous comparisons between the two flow components. SOHO/MDI Doppler observations made during the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 exhibit fluctuations of supergranule characteristics (global averages of the supergranule size, size-range and horizontal velocity) with periods of 3-5 days. Similar fluctuations have been observed in SDO/HMI Dopplergrams and the high correlation between co-temporal HMI &amp; MDI suggest a solar origin. Their nature has been probed by invoking data simulations that produce realistic Dopplergrams based on MDI data., In 2009, Cygnus X-3 (Cyg X-3) became the first microquasar to be detected in the GeV \\u03b3-ray regime, via the satellites Fermi and AGILE. The addition of this new band to the observational toolbox holds promise for building a more detailed understanding of the relativistic jets of this and other systems. We present a rich data set of radio, hard and soft X-ray, and \\u03b3-ray observations of Cyg X-3 made during a flaring episode in 2010 May. We detect a ~3 day softening and recovery of the X-ray emission, followed almost immediately by a ~1 Jy radio flare at 15 GHz, followed by a 4.3\\u03c3 \\u03b3-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) ~1.5 days later. The radio sampling is sparse, but we use archival data to argue that it is unlikely the \\u03b3-ray flare was followed by any significant unobserved radio flares. In this case, the sequencing of the observed events is difficult to explain in a model in which the \\u03b3-ray emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the companion star's radiation field. Our observations suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsible for \\u03b3-ray emission from Cyg X-3., Supergranulation exhibits both radial and horizontal velocity components within Doppler data. The weak, radial flows drag magnetic field lines to the surface while their strong, divergent, horizontal counterparts advect the field to the edges of the supergranulation cells. Field congregation at supergranule boundaries is observed in magnetic filed images and via Ca II K observations of the chromospheric network. <P />Supergranulation characteristics, such as typical sizes and velocities, have been studied using MDI Doppler data and tracked over 60-days of observations made in 1996 and 2008, relating to periods of solar minimum. Time-series of these characteristics exhibit regular fluctuations on the order of 3-5 days. These time-series are analyzed to extract frequency information and cross-correlated to investigate any temporal link between the characteristics. <P />Whether the fluctuations are an instrumental artifact is studied by comparing contemporaneous time series produced from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. There exists a high correlation between the two time-series showing that the fluctuations are solar in origin., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that manifests itself on the photosphere as a cellular network of around 35 Mm across, with a turnover lifetime of 1 - 2 days. It is strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field. The horizontal, divergent flows within supergranule cells carry local field lines to the cell boundaries, while the rotational properties of supergranule upflows may contribute to the restoration of the poloidal field as part of the dynamo mechanism, which controls the solar cycle. The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended length. It is of interest to study whether the convective phenomena that influence the solar magnetic field during this time differed in character from periods of previous minima. This study investigates three characteristics (velocity components, sizes and lifetimes) of solar supergranulation. Comparisons of these characteristics are made between the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 using MDI Doppler data from 1996 and 2008, respectively. It is found that whereas the lifetimes are equal during both epochs (around 18 h), the sizes are larger in 1996 (35.9 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm) than in 2008 (35.0 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm), while the dominant horizontal velocity flows are weaker (139 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 1996; 141 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 2008). Although numerical differences are seen, they are not conclusive proof of the most recent minimum being inherently unusual., The microquasar Cygnus X-3 is one of the few Galactic sources known to produce relativistic jets and can be one of the brightest radio sources in the Galaxy when flaring. In late 2009 it became the first such system to be seen in the gamma-ray regime with detections by both AGILE and Fermi. We have observed Cyg X-3 at 3 GHz every 5 days for the past six months with the Allen Telescope Array in conjunction with space-based X-ray (INTEGRAL, RXTE) and gamma-ray (Fermi) observations. We present results from both the long-term dataset and intensive observing sessions in which we obtain the radio lightcurve of Cyg X-3 on 10-minute timescales. We focus particularly on a May 2010 minor flare event for which we have coverage in all three bands.The first phase of the ATA was funded through generous grants from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. UC Berkeley, the SETI Institute, the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 0540599), Sun Microsystems, Xilinx, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Papadopoulos, and other corporations and individual donors contributed additional funding., Following the announcement of a 98 GHz flare from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (ATel #3130), we observed it with the <A href=\\\"http://ral.berkeley.edu/ata/\\\">Allen Telescope Array</A> (Welch et al., <A href=\\\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009IEEEP..97.1438W\\\">2009 Proc. IEEE 97 1438</A> for 2.5 hours beginning at 2011 January 28.848 UT (MJD 55589.848), about 4.0 hours after the 98 GHz observations concluded., The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended duration. Among the various fields of study, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. This study continues previous investigations of the characteristics of solar supergranulation, a convection component strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field, namely the time-evolution of the global mean of supergranule cell size, determined from spectral analysis of MDI Dopplergrams from the two previous solar minima. Analyses of the global mean of supergranule sizes show a quasi-oscillatory nature to the evolution of this particular supergranule characteristic. Performing similar analyses on realistic, synthetic Doppler images show similar time-dependent characteristics. We conclude that the observed fluctuations are not observational artifacts, and that an underlying trend exists within the evolution of the supergranulation network., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4 (+O?) +O8I: system HD 36402 (BAT99-38) in the LMC shows emission characteristic of heated dust. Although HD 36402 is close to two luminous YSOs, it is possible to distinguish its emission at wavelengths less than 10 microns. Simple modelling indicates a dust temperature near 800 K and mass of about 1.5 \\u00d7 10^{-7} M_\\u2299 amorphous carbon grains. The dust emission appears to be variable. It is apparent that Wolf Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that assists in the outward transportation of internal energy. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for around half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO is making fresh observations of convection phenomena at a higher cadence and a higher resolution that should make granular features visible. Granulation and supergranulation characteristics can now be compared within the same datasets, which may lead to further understanding of any mutual influences. The temporal and spatial enhancements of HMI will also reduce the noise level within studies of convection so that more detailed studies of their characteristics may be made. We present analyses of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams that provide new estimates of convection cell sizes, lifetimes, and velocity flows, as well as the rotation rates of the convection patterns across the solar disk. We make comparisons with previous data produced by MDI, as well as from data simulations., Solar supergranulation plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. It is clearly detected within SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams, from which a variety of properties may be derived. Techniques that extract spatial, temporal, and kinematic characteristics and provide comparisons for the two most recent solar minima are described. Although supergranule lifetimes are comparable between these minima, their sizes may be slightly smaller during the recent minimum., Visual observations of NSV 19431 and YY Cen spanning the twentyeight years 1980 through 2007 are discussed. These show NSV 19431 is a Mira star of mean period of 298.1 days and visual brightness range of 10.8 to fainter than 15.0. Elements for determining the dates of maximum brightness are JD 2447700 \\u00b1 298.1 days (\\u00b110 days). The O-C diagram shows what appear to be random cycleto-cycle fluctuations with a current mean cycle of 298.1 days, evident from the maximum of JD 2447700 (1989). <P />YY Cen is a Mira star of mean period 371.3 days and brightness range 10.6 to fainter than 15.0. On at least three occasions during this twenty-eight years YY Cen has experienced individual cycles that are significantly longer or shorter than the 371.3-day mean period. Subsequent cycles remain close to the mean period but there is a resulting clear shift in the O-C values. Elements for predicting the dates of maximum brightness are JD2446897 \\u00b1 371.3 days (\\u00b110 days), but they should be treated with some caution due to the random instances of long/short cycles observed thus far and which may prove to be a long term characteristic of YY Cen., With its elongated tail and extended periods of zero activity, the period marking the transition from solar cycle 23 to 24 has seemed peculiar when compared to other minima. Among the various phenomena studied, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. <P />Convection in the Sun plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. The observed phenomena are strongly linked within both observational and physical regimes. <P />This study uses SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams to highlight supergranulation within the line-of-sight velocity data. Suites of analysis methods are applied to time-series of Doppler images to quantitatively describe supergranule flow velocities, spatial scales and temporal lifetimes. <P />The results show similarities in supergranule evolution (1/e lifetimes of 18 hours), while their sizes are smaller and their flows stronger during the 23-24 minimum compared to 22-23. We also present provisional results of statistical analyses performed both within and between the various data sets, some of which tend to show a quasi-oscillatory nature. <P />Future studies to place this work in the wider context of the solar cycle are discussed, as a whole as well as investigations of supergranule characteristics found in various other data such as magnetograms and CaIIK images. Observed hemispheric asymmetries will be presented and how our methods may be applied to further these enquiries., The potential role of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the protostellar jet phenomenon is uncertain but intriguing. A number of works in theory and simulation have explored whether and how the MRI may be important to the processes of jet formation, powering, launching, and collimation. Not all of this work is directly related to protostellar jets, but much of it is. <P />Here, I do not discuss experiments that attempt to reproduce the magnetorotational instability in the laboratory. Rather, I discuss laboratory experiments on meridional flows in viscoelastic fluids and their relationship to MRI-driven jet flows, as I have previously. I argue that these laboratory experiments have much more to tell us about the nature of jets, and jets in protostars in particular. <P />To this end, I discuss briefly how these laboratory analogs of protostellar jets may posses a critical surface analogous to the transonic point in astrophysical jets. I show how the momentum flux and kinetic energy flux in the laboratory experiments may relate to these corresponding fluxes in protostellar jets, and I show how these fluxes depend upon the rotation speed of the central object. I discuss the differing roles of angular momentum transport in the laboratory and in astrophysical jets, and the salient differences between these two systems. <P />Finally, I argue that abandonment of a few common theoretical assumptions regarding the flow conditions in the jet launching region can lead to the hypothesis that a turbulent, thick accretion flow in protostars can produce jets without any magnetorotational acceleration whatsoever. Most importantly, the accretion flow must be hot and geometrically thick. To the extent that this is analogous to a very thick boundary layer, this contradicts the standard argument that accretion boundary layers must be relatively thin when they exist., , Although the relationship between the far-infrared and centimeter-wave radio luminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations in astronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In one interpretation, the \\\"calorimeter model,\\\" rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmic ray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship. Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled synchrotron emission. In 2006, Thompson et al. presented a simple parameterized model to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise even in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization losses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42 element Allen Telescope Array (ATA), we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp 220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadband continuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with high-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal and nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the centimeter-wave regime and cannot be well modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson et al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen, and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model parameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data. Assuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index of p = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to &gt;99% confidence. We describe in detail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistency checks used for broadband spectral observations with the ATA., The galactic center (GC) teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. While slow radio transients have been detected toward the GC both serendipitously and systematically, the characterization of these sources has typically suffered from poor spectral and temporal coverage. The ongoing ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) improves on previous work in both of these domains. In the frequency domain, the AGCTS surveys the GC at 1.43 and 2.01 GHz simultaneously using two correlators of the 42-element Allen Telescope Array (ATA-42). In the temporal domain, AGCTS observations are conducted about four nights a week and have been running for more than six months. During a typical night, 25 square degrees near the galactic plane are observed for a total of 3 hours. The AGCTS dataset will thus have excellent temporal sampling of a large area with spectral index information. We present some early results and discuss our analysis techniques. While the correlator observations proceed, three beamformers are used to conduct a SETI search in the field of view. These commensal observations are discussed in another poster in this session (\\\"The ATA Galactic Center Survey: SETI Observations in 2009\\u201d by P. Backus)., The galactic center teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. The ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) started in May 2009 and is currently observing 20 square degrees of sky for 6 hours every night commensally with SETI observations. The AGCTS will collect 6 months of data operating simultaneously at two frequencies, generating a powerful dataset with spectral index information and uniform temporal coverage and observational parameters. We expect to attain a sensitivity of 1 mJy/bm per hour-long integration and either detect significant numbers of transient events or establish robust upper limits on event rates. We present our observing and analysis techniques as well as preliminary results., Aims: We present a new method for the treatment of the advection of solar supergranulation by giant cells, a large-scale analogue to the observed property of granule advection by supergranules. <BR />Methods: The proposed method is derived from a description of solar convection via spherical harmonics and spectral coefficients, allowing the investigation of the influence of a giant cell component on a realistic supergranule signal. <BR />Results: We show that a supergranule pattern derived from real data, as well as a simplified test signal, can be advected by a giant cell component of various sizes. <BR />Conclusions: The identified behaviour is in analogy to observed supergranulation patterns, including those based on MDI Dopplergrams, which show wavelike supergranulation patterns, even after the removal of the geometric projection effect. Our method is an important step towards the construction of future models involving supergranule flow patterns advected by a giant cell flow. Nevertheless, additional efforts are required to obtain a final verification of giant cells as a separate component of the solar photospheric convection spectrum. <P />New address: <P />NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA., , We present infrared photometry of the episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet system WR19 (LS3), tracking its fading from a third observed dust formation episode in 2007 and strengthening the view that these episodes are periodic (P = 10.1 +/- 0.1y). Radial velocities (RVs) of the O9 component observed between 2001 and 2008 show RV variations consistent with WR19 being a spectroscopic binary of high eccentricity (e = 0.8), having periastron passage in 2007.14, shortly before the phase of dust formation. In this respect, WR19 resembles the archetypical episodic dust-making colliding wind binary system WR140. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, in allocations 67.D-0043, 70.D-0266, 72.D-0070, 73.D-0027, 74.D-0116, 76.D-0029, 78.D-0001, 79.D-0092 and 80.D-0198. <P />E-mail: pmw@roe.ac.uk, Convection in the Sun plays an important role as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. Magnetic field phenomena are thus inextricably linked to the convective process, an example being the gathering of magnetic field lines around supergranule boundaries observed as the chromospheric network. <P />Our research asks to what extent variations in the global magnetic field affect particular characteristics of photospheric convection features, using Dopplergrams derived from SOHO/MDI data during the course of Solar Cycle 23. <P />We look ahead to the higher resolution data that SDO/HMI will provide and any further insight such data may provide., We present high-resolution infrared (2-18 \\u03bcm) images of the archetypal periodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet binary system WR140 (HD 193793) taken between 2001 and 2005, and multi-colour (J - [19.5]) photometry observed between 1989 and 2001. The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical `pinwheel', WR104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be significantly redder in (nbL'-[3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]-[12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf-Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 +/- 8 and 243 +/- 7 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 \\u03bcm) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper motion ~320 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four to five months earlier than those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane., While the correlation between the far infrared (FIR) and radio emission of starforming (SF) galaxies is well-supported observationally, a detailed understanding of this relationship remains elusive. The \\\"calorimeter\\\" model of the FIR-radio correlation requires that relativistic electrons in SF galaxies cool completely before they exit the galactic disk. Thompson et al. (2006) show that breaks in the radio spectra of SF galaxies at GHz frequencies can be used to diagnose whether this condition, in fact, holds. <P />We present Allen Telescope Array (ATA) observations of the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M82 and the extreme starburst galaxy Arp 220. The continuous frequency capability of the ATA enables the construction of spectra with dense sampling at frequencies between 0.5 and 7 GHz. Repeated measurements indicate a typical precision in flux density of better than 10% in an individual scan. Our data allow measurement of variations in the spectral index across the range of frequencies observed. <P />The techniques for obtaining continuous spectra demonstrated herein also have valuable applications to the study of many other targets, including compact symmetric objects, gigahertz-peaked sources, and intra-day variables. The lessons learned from their implementation on the ATA have ramifications for future centimeter-wavelength observatories with continuous frequency coverage such as the Extended Very Large Array and the Square Kilometer Array. <P />This work was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship., While both society and astronomy have evolved greatly over the past fifty years, the academic institutions and incentives that shape our field have remained largely stagnant. As a result, the astronomical community is faced with several major challenges, including: (1) the training that we provide does not align with the skills that future astronomers will need, (2) the postdoctoral phase is becoming increasingly demanding and demoralizing, and (3) our jobs are increasingly unfriendly to families with children. Solving these problems will require conscious engineering of our profession. Fortunately, this Decadal Review offers the opportunity to revise outmoded practices to be more effective and equitable. The highest priority of the Subcommittee on the State of the Profession should be to recommend specific, funded activities that will ensure the field meets the challenges we describe., The recent high-resolution infrared images of the enigmatic cocoon stars in the Quintuplet cluster showing them to have ``pinwheel'' tails, and the deduction that they are colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries, shows how far the study of colliding-wind dust formation has come since the first discovery of heated carbon dust around the classical WC9 star Ve2-45 (WR 104) in the early days of infrared astronomy. The formation of dust is the least expected, and hardest to understand, process attributed to colliding stellar winds, and direct evidence of the connection is only now becoming available. I will review recent work and consider systems showing a range of dust-formation phenomena, including the prototypical epsiodic dust-maker WR 140 and the variable dust-maker WR 70, also long studied by Virpi Niemela and her colleagues., Continuous frequency coverage is an important scientific and technical goal of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We investigate one avenue of reaching this goal with data taken from the high-resolution, broadband correlator of the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). With a total frequency coverage of 0.5 to 11.2 GHz and 1024 channels in a spectral window 100 MHz wide, the ATA is an ideal exploratory instrument for this kind of science. We present observations of calibrators taken over a broad swath of the ATA's frequency range and show how the well-known spectral indices of these sources can be recovered. With this consistency check in hand, a few sample broadband spectra and images of more scientifically interesting targets are presented. Our experiments explore the continuous frequency performance of the ATA antennas, feeds, and receivers and also identify the limitations that radio frequency interference place on our ability to make images. Further observations of this kind at the ATA will yield not only intriguing standalone science results but also valuable knowledge about the developments needed to endow the SKA with a robust continuous frequency capability., In recent years, solar observations have moved from ground-based telescopes to observatories on Earth orbiting satellites, such as SOHO. They provide us with a clear and uninterrupted view of the solar disk. One instrument upon SOHO, the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), has proved fruitful in providing not only important information of the solar photosphere but, in combination with helioseismic methods, a method for probing the solar interior. <P />This dissertation discusses current investigations by myself and my collaborators into surface manifestations of convection phenomena, using Doppler velocity data from MDI and produced from computer simulations. The Doppler data reveal convection cells much larger than the granulation seen easily by optical telescopes. These supergranules' originate deeper within the convection layer than the granules and, like their smaller counterparts, are heavily influential in structuring the magnetic field and subsequently play an important role in controlling aspects of the solar activity cycle. <P />My work presented in this dissertation shows that the supergranulation pattern seems to rotate faster than the surface plasma. It has been suggested that the pattern is driven by wave-like phenomena, but instead we find the reason is a geometric effect with respect to the observer. We further find that supergranules are also responsible for observed corrugation features on the solar surface, which previously had been interpreted as Rossby wave hills. <P />We extend our convection spectrum and Doppler map production simulations to include axisymmetric flows such as differential rotation, which contribute to the evolution of the velocity field. These models assist in understanding how such large-scale surface flows influence the surface motions of supergranules. <P />Lastly, I describe the construction of a numerical experiment to study the influence of a 'giant-cell' velocity field on the supergranule pattern. Such non-axisymmetric flows would further contribute to supergranule advection and the results of such experiments may assist in the observation of these hitherto elusive 'giant-cells'., Geometrically thin accretion disks are azimuthally supersonic, but vertically subsonic. Outflow in well-collimated jets is typically axially supersonic, but radially and azimuthally subsonic in the jet core. Particularly in a thick inner disk or flow, the transition from supersonic azimuthal motion to supersonic axial motion can be made in a flow in which the gas that is ejected is nowhere subsonic. Here, we investigate this possibility within protostellar jet systems. Such a scenario bears some semblance to scramjets, i.e. supersonic combustion ramjets, in which gas flow is nowhere subsonic. Of course, in the case of protostellar jets, the energy source is not combustion but release of gravitational potential energy from accreting gas and/or transfer of mechanical energy from a rotating central object. Nevertheless, there are some dynamical and thermodynamic similarities between scramjets and our protostellar jet outflow scenario, which we explore., We explore the nature of ``hills'' observed on the solar surface that had previously been attributed to Rossby waves. We investigate the solar hills phenomenon by analyzing the output from a synthetic model based solely on the observed solar photospheric convection spectrum. We show that the characteristics of these hills can be explained by the corrugation of the surface produced by the radial flows of the convection. The hills in our simulations are dominated by supergranules, a well-known component of solar convection. Rossby waves have been predicted to exist within the Sun and may play an important role in the dynamics of the solar interior, including the Sun's differential rotation and magnetic dynamo. Our study suggests, however, that the hills observed at the solar limb do not confirm the existence of solar Rossby waves., Visual observations of the neglected Mira variable V407 Sco during the ten-year interval 1997 through 2006 provide a revised period and epoch for maximum brightness. The dates of maximum are represented by the elements JD 2453612 \\u00b1 401.5 (\\u00b1 4 days) \\u00b7 E. The brightness range is from magnitude 10.2 to fainter than 14.5., Observations of the 1.083-\\u03bcm He i line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile, consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (\\u03b8) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10-\\u03bcm) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a `splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., Visual observations of DI Car between 2001 June and 2005 August are plotted according to phase relative to the previously published elements HJD 2438553.70 + 29.210 days. They support the suggestion that DI Car is a regular pulsating star and confirms the variable depth of minimum brightness., Observers have misidentified the semiregular variable T CMa over many years due to the use of charts with insufficient detail. A detailed chart is provided to allow for correct identification and it is also suggested T CMa may be non-variable and should be dropped from observing lists., Previous work on the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation of the solar convective zone (SCZ) generally consists either of semi-analytic approaches in which a simple turbulence model is adopted, or full direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In both <P />instances the inclusion of magnetic fields has been troublesome. Also, <P />both approaches have had difficulty reproducing the known angular velocity profile of the SCZ; this is the Taylor Number Puzzle. <P />I discuss preliminary work in which I incorporate magnetic fields into a viscoelastic turbulence model for the SCZ and apply this to the problem of meridional circulation and angular momentum balance. The principle idea is that turbulent magnetic fields act like long polymers and give the plasma elastic properties. I suggest that such an approach may help solve the Taylor Number Puzzle of the SCZ and bring theoretical predictions for the large-scale motion of the SCZ in line with observations., Visual observations of the little studied Mira variable star SW Hor during the 18-year interval 1986 through 2003 are presented. These provide the basic parameters of its variability, information that had previously been lacking from the catalogue data. An extreme visual magnitude range of 9.9 to fainter than 15 is found and a mean period of 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 days determined. Elements for maximum brightness are JD 2447124 + 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 day, Many detailed observations of jet launching in young stellar objects (YSOs) appear consistent with magnetocentrifugal models of acceleration. This has been interpreted as support for these models. There are other possibilities, however. <P />In previous work, I described how turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may help launch jets. As conceived and formulated, this jet launching mechanism is not magnetocentrifugal. The MRI-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence creates hoop-stresses both on and above the midplane, and I suggested that these confine and collimate the outflow. This is fundamentally different from far-downstream hoop-stress collimation of jets beyond the Alfv\\u00e9n surface such as occurs in traditional magnetocentrifugal jet mechanisms. Indeed, in standard MHD wind theory, the hoop-stress must vanish on the midplane. <P />There now exist substantial observational constraints on several quantities fundamental to jet launching in YSOs, including the ratio of jet mass flux to accretion mass flux, the jet thrust, and the jet angular momentum flux. Here I show that this consistency is not as robust a test of magnetocentrifugal acceleration as might be hoped. <P />In particular, I construct a non-magnetocentrifugal jet model based on MRI-driven turbulent jet confinement and collimation. I show how this model may explain jets in YSOs consistently with the observational constraints, especially in high accretion-rate systems. Finally, I discuss potential observational discriminants between this preliminary model and the magnetocentrifugal class of models., X Muscae is amongst the stars listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as \\\"not studied.\\\" Visual observations by the author during the 5-year interval 1999 through 2003 indicate this is a large amplitude variable star, probably of the Mira type. A visual magnitude range of 12.2 to fainter than 15.0 is found with a mean cycle of 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 days. A preliminary ephemeris for determining maximum brightness is JD 2452085 + 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 E days., Supergranulation is a well established component of solar convection and visible on the solar surface as cellular structures. The convective upflow within a supergranule cell overshoots the equilibrium solar surface creating a corrugated surface. The hills associated with these upflows have been detected as they pass over the solar limb. Their discovery was initially attributed to Rossby waves, arising from r-mode oscillations in the Sun where the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. We analyze these hills by producing an artificial height map derived from the radial component of supergranule Doppler velocity data constructed from the spectral components of a synthetic photospheric convection spectrum. We are able to show that the observed signals leading to the detection of these solar hills can be modeled by applying the same methods that lead to the Rossby wave `discovery', prompting the conclusion that the corrugation has its origins in supergranulation., We present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves of transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previously published by Cooper &amp; Showman. We find that observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC observations at 3.6\\u03bcm of a single secondary eclipse should permit sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper &amp; Showman model of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a similarly robust detection., , We discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin disk limit. These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh criterion, and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative and transport processes in these disks are hydrodynamic in nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the hydrodynamics of laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often experimentally unstable even in the absence of a linear instability. The transition to turbulence in these systems, as well as the large linear transient amplification of initial disturbances, may depend upon the non-self-adjoint nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of perturbations to the background state. We find that small initial perturbations can produce large growth in accretion disks in the shearing sheet approximation with shearing box boundary conditions, despite the absence of any linear instability. Furthermore, the differential operator that propagates initial conditions forward in time is asymptotically close (as a function of Reynolds number) to possessing growing eigenmodes. The similarity to the dynamics of laboratory shear flows is suggestive that accretion disks might be hydrodynamically unstable despite the lack of any known instability mechanism., Rossby waves have been well established as oceanographic and atmospheric features on Earth in which the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. Rossby waves have also been predicted to exist as \\\"r-mode oscillations\\\" on rotating stars and the Sun. Recently, reports have claimed that such phenomena exist as low amplitude, long wavelength features - \\\"hills\\\" - on the surface of the Sun by analyzing spatial and temporal signatures of the solar limb from the MDI instrument on SOHO. We have used simulated data to conduct a similar analysis of the limb and discovered that the reported signatures can be obtained by considering only the supergranule convection pattern., Lightning and related natural electrical discharge phenomena occur on many solar system bodies, most notably the Earth and the gas giants. It has also been suggested that lightning within the protosolar nebula may explain the melt properties of meteoritic chondrules. We consider conditions under which electrical discharge might occur within the interstellar medium. Such discharge would most likely require a gas with a small ionization fraction, such as a diffuse HI region or a molecular cloud. We discuss processes that might create the electric field or emf necessary for electrical breakdown. After considering grain charging rates in turbulent gas, we estimate the magnitude of charge separation by turbulent clustering of charged dust grains, and estimate time scales for charge neutralization by the electron current. We calculate a local heating rate due to an interstellar discharge and use the appropriate cooling rates for each type of region to estimate a temperature history associated with the discharge. Possible chemical and electromagnetic signatures of interstellar lightning are discussed., , Star formation rates on the galactic scale are described phenomenologically by two distinct relationships, as emphasized recently by Elmegreen [Elmegreen, B.G., 2002. ApJ, 577, 206. astro-ph/0207114.]. The first of these is the Schmidt law, which is a power-law relation between the star formation rate SFR and the column density \\u03a3. The other relationship is that there is a cutoff in the gas density below which star formation shuts off. The purpose of this paper is to argue that: (1) these two relationships can be accommodated by a single functional form of the Schmidt law, (2) this functional form is motivated by the hypothesis that star formation is a critical phenomenon, and that as a corollary, (3) the existence of a sharp cutoff may thus be an emergent property of galaxies, as was argued by Seiden [Seiden, P.E.,1983. ApJ, 266, 555.], as opposed to the classical view that this cutoff is due to an instability criterion., P. Williams, Heathcote, New South Wales, reports his visual discovery of a possible nova (mag 10.5) on Apr. 6.565 UT, noting it to be situated 4'.8 southeast of the nearby R CrB-type variable V517 Oph (itself invisible near minimum); Williams gave the position for the new star as R.A. = 17h15m30s, Decl. = -29o09'30\\\" (equinox 2000.0).

We find evidence for OB companions to the WC9 stars WR 59 and WR 65, but not WR 121 or WR 117. We identify lines of N III-V and possibly N II in the spectrum of WR 88, one of the few Galactic WC9 stars which do not make circumstellar dust, and suggest that WR 88 is a transitional WN--WC9 object and less evolved than the other WC9 stars. On the other hand, the possible identification of a strong emission line at 4176 in the spectrum of WR 117 with Ne I suggests that this star is more evolved than other WC9 stars studied., , We present results from a spectroscopic search for massive companions to dust-making Galactic WC9 stars as a step to testing the paradigm that dust formation in these systems requires colliding winds to produce over densities.

One argument is based upon consideration that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI, in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of direct numerical MHD simulations of collapsars and thick accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself. Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally, I suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here, should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them., , , Results of 18 years observation provide the previously lacking basic catalogue data on the Mira type variable star IY Carinae. A visual magnitude range of 10.1 to fainter then 15.0 and a mean period of 283.90 days are found. An epoch for determining dates of maximum brightness is JD 2447919\\u00b1283.90 days, Oxygen and carbon data from eight stalagmites from northwest South Island are combined to produce composite records of \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O and \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C from 23.4 ka to the present. The chronology is anchored by 43 thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium series ages. Delta <SUP>18</SUP>O values are interpreted as having a first order positive relationship to temperature, but also to be influenced by precipitation in a complex manner. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C is interpreted as responding negatively to increases in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and precipitation amount. Six climatic phases are recognized. After adjustment of 1.2\\u2030 for the ice volume effect, the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record between 23 and 18 ka varies around -3.72\\u2030 compared to the Holocene average of -3.17\\u2030. Late-glacial warming commenced between 18.2 and 17.8 ka and accelerated after 16.7 ka, culminating in a positive excursion between 14.70 and 13.53 ka. This was followed by a significant negative excursion between 13.53 and 11.14 ka of up to 0.55\\u2030 depth that overlapped the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and spanned the Younger Dryas (YD). Positive \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O excursions at 11.14 ka and 6.91-6.47 ka represent the warmest parts of the Holocene. The mid-Holocene from 6 to 2 ka was marked by negative excursions that coincide with increased glacial activity in the South Island. A short positive excursion from 0.71 to 0.57 ka was slightly later than the Medieval Warm Period of Europe. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C values were high until 17.79 ka after which there was an abrupt decrease to 17.19 ka followed by a steady decline to a minimum at 10.97 ka. Then followed a general increase, suggesting a drying trend, to 3.23 ka followed by a further general decline. The abrupt decrease in \\u03b4-values after 17.79 ka probably corresponds to an increase in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and wetness at the end of the Last Glaciation, but the reversal identified in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record from 13.53 to 11.14 ka was not reflected in \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C changes. The lowest \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C values coincided with the early Holocene climatic suboptimum when conditions were relatively wet as well as mild. Major trends in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>c</SUB> record are similar to the Northern Hemisphere, but second order detail is often distinctly different. Consequently, at the millennial scale, a more convincing case can be made for asymmetric climatic response between the two hemispheres rather than synchronicity., P. Williams, Heathcote, N.S.W., reports that this eruptive variable (cf. IAUC 4676, 4966), usually near mag 18, appears to be undergoing an outburst and is near maximum brightness for the first time since 1997, as indicated by his visual magnitude estimates: 2004 Nov. 14.493 UT, [13.5; Dec. 18.497, [13.5; 2005 Jan. 5.509, 14.0; 5.518, 14.0. CCD images obtained by C. Bembrick (Mt. Tarana, N.S.W.; mag V = 14.0) on Jan. 6.5 and by S. Lee (Coonabarabran, N.S.W.) on Jan. 6.6 confirm the current bright state., , We re-examine the Boussinesq hypothesis of an effective turbulent viscosity within the context of simple closure considerations for models of strong magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Reynolds-stress and turbulent Maxwell-stress closure models will necessarily introduce a suite of transport coefficients, all of which are to some degree model-dependent. One of the most important coefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which until recently has been relatively ignored. We discuss this relaxation within the context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in steady high fluid Reynolds-number, high magnetic-Reynolds-number shearing flows. The relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress is not constrained by the shear time scale, in contrast with Reynolds-stress closure models for purely hydrodynamical turbulence. As a result, the anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, even for the case of zero mean-field considered here, cannot be neglected. This shear-generated anisotropy can be interpreted as being due to an effective turbulent elasticity, in analogy to the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity. We claim that this turbulent elasticity should be important for any astrophysical problem in which the turbulent stress in quasi-steady shear has been treated phenomenologically with an effective viscosity., Observations of the 1.083-micron He I line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P-Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (theta) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10 micron) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a 'splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., We report here an example of a series of computer simulations of the formation of disk galaxies, including a standard cold dark matter component, gas, and star formation, which result in objects which closely resemble observed giant galaxies, with a population of long-lived dwarf satellites which contain little or no non-baryonic dark matter., Using a set of 60 Tree-SPH simulations of the formation of an individual galaxy, including star formation physics, we quantitatively assess the numerical accuracy and convergence of these methods. For simulations using 24000 particles in total, the gross structures of the resultant galaxies are reliably resolved., In many SPH simulations of galaxy formation a lower limit is imposed on the kernel radius h equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. It has been found that such a constraint can in some circumstances compromise the spatial resolution to which hydrodynamical quantities are evaluated to the extent that the evolution of the gross features of a numerical galaxies are affected. Such effects can be avoided by allowing h to evolve freely to maintain a roughly constant number of neighbours in SPH summations. Here we focus on how imposing a constraint on h may affect the velocity field., In simulations of galaxy formation that use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the gas component, a lower limit on the value of the kernel smoothing radius h is often imposed, usually equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. In this paper we analyze a series of benchmark hydrodynamics problems and test galaxy formation simulations, aimed at quantifying the effects of imposing such a constraint on h. We have found that in some circumstances, such an approach can severely degrade the accuracy of solutions. In such cases, using large values of h results in an over-smoothed density field, i.e., a decrease in the calculated values of density \\u03c1 and density gradients \\u2207\\u03c1, which unphysically decreases the \\u2207\\u03c1/\\u03c1 part of pressure accelerations. In simulations of galaxy disks, constrained h may also result in unphysical angular momentum transfer, affecting the gross structure of the numerical galaxy. Such an effect occurs because particles in the central regions of the disk sample the velocity field in SPH summations over too large a range in velocities. We demonstrate here that when h is allowed to evolve freely to maintain a constant number of neighbors in SPH summations, such unwanted effects can be avoided and accuracy improved. At the same time, significant savings in computational cost can also be made by using the unconstrained h approach., , We have argued that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in an accretion disk naturally produces hoop-stresses, and that in a geometrically-thick flow these stresses could both drive and collimate an outflow. We based this argument on an analogy of turbulent MHD fluids to viscoelastic fluids, in which azimuthal shear flow creates hoop-stresses that cause a variety of flow phenomena, including the Weissenberg effect in which a fluid climbs a spinning rod. One of the more important differences between the Weissenberg effect and astrophysical jets is the source of power. In our previous analysis, we only considered the power due to the spin-down torque on the central object, and thus found that we could only drive an outflow if the central object were maximally rotating. Here we take into account the energy that is liberated by the accreting matter, and describe a scenario in which this energy couples to the outflow to create a thermodynamic engine., Inertia-gravity waves exist ubiquitously throughout the stratified parts of the atmosphere and ocean. They are generated by local velocity shears, interactions with topography, and as geostrophic (or spontaneous) adjustment radiation. Relatively little is known about the details of their interaction with the large-scale flow, however. We report on a joint model/laboratory study of a flow in which inertia-gravity waves are generated as spontaneous adjustment radiation by an evolving large-scale mode. We show that their subsequent impact upon the large-scale dynamics is generally small. However, near a potential transition from one large-scale mode to another, in a flow which is simultaneously baroclinically-unstable to more than one mode, the inertia-gravity waves may strongly influence the selection of the mode which actually occurs., We discuss turbulent elasticity within the context of the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone (SCZ). The concept of a turbulent elasticity is complementary to the notion of a turbulent viscosity. In the case of turbulent viscosity, the small-scale stochastic component of the turbulent fluid motions behaves like molecules in ordinary viscous fluids to create an effective viscous response of the stress. Likewise, in the case of turbulent elasticity, the small-scale stochastic component of the magnetic field behaves like polymers in solution in viscoelastic fluids to create an effective elastic response of the fluid to stress. This elastic response creates hoop-stresses in azimuthal shear flow. We demonstrate that the hoop-stresses generated by turbulent elasticity induce a component to the meridional flow in the SCZ that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology, that is to say, north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone, for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. In fact it is commonly observed in the secondary flow phenomena of viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory that elastic forces act oppositely to inertial forces. We thus argue that the addition of a turbulent elasticity may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' One additional effect of an effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves, which are essentially Alvf\\u00e9n waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model should thus make testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum., We discuss turbulent magnetic fields and the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone. We demonstrate that the stresses generated by turbulent magnetic fields induce a component to the meridional flow that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology i.e. north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. We thus argue that the inclusion of turbulent Maxwell stresses may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' We demonstrate this by solving for the equilibrium angular momentum balance and meridional circulation using a numerical pseudo-spectral code that we describe. This code includes turbulent magnetic fields through a model that includes an effective turbulent elasticity. An additional effect of this effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves which are essentially Alvfenic waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model in addition to fitting the observed solar rotation profile also thus makes testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum, We propose a viscoelastic model of the Maxwell stresses due to the disorganized magnetic field in MRI-driven MHD turbulence. Viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory are known to produce jet-like structures under the action of a rotating sphere. Here we argue that a similar mechanism may help explain jets in protostellar systems. Such jets would be driven not by large scale organized magnetic fields, but by the mean field stresses of small scale tangled magnetic fields., \",\n          \"The astronomical community is grappling with the increasing volume and complexity of data produced by modern telescopes, due to difficulties in reducing, accessing, analyzing, and combining archives of data. To address this challenge, we propose the establishment of a coordinating body, an \\\"entity,\\\" with the specific mission of enhancing the interoperability, archiving, distribution, and production of both astronomical data and software. This report is the culmination of a workshop held in February 2023 on the Future of Astronomical Data Infrastructure. Attended by 70 scientists and software professionals from ground-based and space-based missions and archives spanning the entire spectrum of astronomical research, the group deliberated on the prevailing state of software and data infrastructure in astronomy, identified pressing issues, and explored potential solutions. In this report, we describe the ecosystem of astronomical data, its existing flaws, and the many gaps, duplication, inconsistencies, barriers to access, drags on productivity, missed opportunities, and risks to the long-term integrity of essential data sets. We also highlight the successes and failures in a set of deep dives into several different illustrative components of the ecosystem, included as an appendix., Answering the pressing astronomical and human questions of our time\\u2014what are the origins of the Universe? how did galaxies, stars, and planets form? is there life elsewhere?\\u2014requires telescope resources beyond what individual universities or private observatories can muster, and they also require much more than the hardware. The most successful modern ground-based astronomical experiments have therefore been those that not only harnessed the resources of large consortia but also maximized their science productivity through early career training, innovative software development, and powerful and user-friendly public data-distribution tools., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as an archetypal mid-scale program, including the technical, scientific, and organizational aspects underpinning its success over the last twenty years. Based on the SDSS experience, we present six recommendations that the funding mechanisms for mid-scale programs should be designed to ensure., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z\\u223c 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z\\u223c 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July., kcorrect fits very restricted spectral energy distribution models to galaxy photometry or spectra in the restframe UV, optical and near-infrared. The main purpose of the fits are for calculating K-corrections. The templates used for the fits may also be interpreted physically, since they are based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar evolution synthesis codes. Thus, for each fit galaxy kcorrect can provide an estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio., Michael Blanton enjoys a history of cosmology focused on large-scale structure in the 'spongy' Universe., We describe a procedure for background subtracting Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of large galaxies on the sky. Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r <SUB>50</SUB> ~ 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data., An essential use of stellar population synthesis methods is to interpret the observations of galaxies, to infer their star-formation and assembly histories. I describe here some of the uses of these techniques over the past few years, primarily in the context of local galaxy redshift surveys. For this purpose, such surveys have both advantages and disadvantages relative to higher signal-to-noise but smaller studies, which I discuss. After discussing general issues, I describe how the substantial model uncertainties impact the analysis of galaxy spectra. Then, I discuss the special case of elliptical galaxies, arguing that investigators have made interesting discoveries even in the absence of perfect (or even good) models. I then describe the desiderata for massive higher redshift surveys and the trade-offs that must be made between cosmological and galaxy-focused science, in qualitative terms., We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types\\u2014spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems\\u2014and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys., In most cosmological theories, the galaxy mass function at small masses is related to the small-scale matter power spectrum. The circular velocity function (closely related to the mass function) is well studied for Local Group dwarfs. However, predictions and measurements are difficult for satellite galaxies because of ram pressure and tidal stripping. By contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by these processes and almost always have 21 cm emission to trace their dynamics. Here we use isolated low-mass dwarf galaxies from the SDSS, with measured 21 cm widths, to test CDM cosmology. We find consistency between the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down to V<SUB>max</SUB> ~ 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our technique yields a direct test of small-scale cosmology that is independent of but weaker than the Ly\\u03b1 forest: warm dark matter particles heavier than 0.5 keV cannot be ruled out (for the case of thermal gravitinos). New, blind H I surveys are expected to uncover a much larger number of isolated low-mass galaxies and will increase the power of our constraints at small scales. Using our sample, we also find that the Tully-Fisher relation for dwarfs is a strong function of environment, and that the baryon fraction is only a weak function of galaxy mass. Together with the strong dependence of gas fraction on environment, these results indicate that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss and the end of star formation are dominated by external, not internal, processes., We propose here for archival research funding to measure the build-up of stellar mass over the last eight billion years, using an unprecedentedly large sample. Measuring the increase of stellar mass in galaxies, and determining its dependence on galaxy type and environment, yields crucial information about the star-formation and merger history of galaxies. This history has been the subject of intense research over the past few years, but has been limited by both systematic effects and by the sizes of the available observational samples. Our PRIMUS survey contains over 200,000 spectroscopic redshifts, measured at 1 percent precision, out to redshift z=1, covering 8 square degrees of SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging. Our sample is flux-limited at i=23 and includes all galaxy types, spanning the red and blue galaxy populations. We have created this sample using a special mode we have developed for the IMACS instrument on the Magellan 6.5m at Las Campanas Observatories: a low dispersion prism in combination with a multi-slit mask. This configuration allows redshift determination of 1 percent accuracy, while also allowing extreme multiplexing to obtain over 2,000 galaxy spectra simultaneously. With the SWIRE optical and infrared imaging in combination with our redshift determinations, we can recover much more accurate estimates of the stellar mass of each galaxy and construct a high signal-to-noise estimate of the stellar mass function over a range of redshifts. These measurements will dramatically improve our current understanding of the build-up of stellar mass, both by decreasing the statistical uncertainty due to sample variance with our massive sample, and by decreasing the systematic uncertainties in stellar masses by using the SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging., We determine what aspects of the density field surrounding galaxies most affect their properties. For Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, we measure the group environment, meaning the host group luminosity and the distance from the group center (hereafter ``groupocentric distance''). For comparison, we measure the surrounding density field on scales ranging from 100 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc to 10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We use the relationship between color and group environment to test the null hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for a residual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. Generally, red galaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales (~100-300 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc) than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure within groups has some importance. At large scales (&gt;1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the actual projected correlation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level with respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly the converse null hypothesis: that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters. These results generally encourage the use of the halo model description of galaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halo mass alone. We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios within the cold dark matter cosmological model., Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections., Most theories of galaxy formation incorporate elements like supernova feedback, ram pressure stripping, and other poorly understood physical effects. Dwarf galaxies, with their shallow potential wells, are the galaxies most sensitive to these processes. Thus, the study of dwarf galaxies may lead to a better understanding of these effects. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, I examine the properties of dwarf satellites of luminous galaxies. By deprojecting the distribution, I determine the three-dimensional radial distribution of satellites around host galaxies. Treating blue (dIrr) and red (dE or dSph) satellites separately, I demonstrate that the trend seen in the Milky Way, that nearby dwarfs are much redder, also holds for other systems. Our results suggest that interaction with a large host is the only process which can end star-formation in dwarfs. I compare these results to theoretical predictions based on semianalytic models., In the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change due to the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, and mergers with other galaxies. Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z~0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z~1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z~1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in <SUP>0.1</SUP>(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ``dry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z~0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z~1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies., We investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, and environments of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We find that (1) the relationship between color and environment persists even to the lowest luminosities we probe (M<SUB>r</SUB>-5log10h~-14) (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlation function has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regions of a given overdensity on small scales (1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the overdensity on large scales (6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies. Of these results, the last has the most immediate application to galaxy formation theory. In particular, it lends support to the notion that a galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matter halo, and not to the larger scale environment. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Interpreting surveys of galaxies which span a range of redshifts requires being able to interpret broad-band observations of galaxies taken through different effective rest-frame bandpasses. All claims of evolution of the galaxy population rely on accurate K-corrections in order to do this. The PI has written widely used software (over 100 registered users and over 100 citations in the literature) for calculating K-corrections in the UV, optical and near-infrared, and proposes to extend this software to self-consistently include the mid and far-infrared. Large public Spitzer surveys like the First Look Survey and SWIRE overlap deep (to redshift unity) public redshift catalogs, and provide an excellent basis for developing these tools. This proposal outlines a plan for developing and testing an appropriate set of templates for fitting SEDs and calculating K-corrections. The tools (in addition to furthering the PI's own work on galaxy evolution) will be publicly released., Dwarf galaxies are simple relative to more luminous galaxies, ideal for testing predictions of cosmology, of star-formation in disks, and of the effect of environment on galaxy properties. To study dwarf galaxies, we have constructed a joint sample of optical, Spitzer, and HI data, including resolved long-slit spectroscopy, showing among other things that these galaxies have extremely low star formation efficiencies. We propose to add archival GALEX data to a joint analysis of dwarf galaxies' optical, infrared, and radio properties to determine their star-formation histories and to better understand galaxy formation in this regime. We will attempt to construct a consistent star-formation history explaining the colors, metallicities, gas contents, and current star-formation rates of dwarf galaxies, and to examine how these properties vary with environment., We examine a sample of low-redshift (10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc&lt;d&lt;150 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) field galaxies including galaxies with luminosities as low as M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh~-12.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2). The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. We present the luminosity function, as well as the broadband properties, of low-luminosity galaxies in this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the slope for M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh&gt;-18. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this sample is \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate that the true low-luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantly low surface brightness, exponential disks, the majority of which are red. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., We examine the relationship between environment and the luminosities, surface brightnesses, colors, and profile shapes of luminous galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For the SDSS sample, galaxy color is the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment. Galaxy color and luminosity-measures of the star formation history-jointly comprise the most predictive pair of properties. At fixed luminosity and color, density is not closely related to surface brightness or to S\\u00e9rsic index-measures of galaxy structure. In the text, we discuss what measurable residual relationships exist, generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity, the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and S\\u00e9rsic indices. In general, these results suggest that the structural properties of galaxies are less closely related to galaxy environment than are their masses and star formation histories. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog. <P />Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics, New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003., We propose to use archival GALEX observations to characterize galaxy spectral energy distributions in the ultraviolet. Our goal is to create a public tool for calculating K-corrections (that is, the transformations between observed fluxes and rest frame fluxes for redshifted sources). This tool will build on and be compatible with widely-used ones we have already made public for the analysis of optical and near-infrared observations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two-micron All Sky Survey. A consistent treatment of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations will simplify data analysis and improve comparison of low-redshift observations of galaxies (typically optical or near-infrared) to high-redshift observations (often in the rest-frame ultraviolet)., We present results on the relationship between the environments, structure, and star-formation history of galaxies, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Measures of the star-formation history, such as color and luminosity, are more closely related to environment than are measures of galaxy structure, such as galaxy concentration and surface brightness. In particular, galaxy concentration does not correlate with environment at fixed color and luminosity. These results suggest that the relationship between density and morphology may be secondary to the relationship between density and star formation history., Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S\\u00e9rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5&lt;M<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;-17.0 mag and 17&lt;\\u03bc<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;24 mag in 1 arcsec<SUP>2</SUP> [the notation <SUP>z</SUP>b represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their rest-frame shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands <SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP>0.1</SUP>z with \\u03bb<SUB>eff</SUB>=(3216,4240,5595,6792,8111\\u00c5), respectively. To estimate the luminosity function, we use a maximum likelihood method that allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, fits for simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates the flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 expressed in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc<SUP>3</SUP> to be (-14.10+/-0.15, -15.18+/-0.03, -15.90+/-0.03, -16.24+/-0.03, -16.56+/-0.02) in (<SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP> 0.1</SUP>z), respectively, for a cosmological model with \\u03a9<SUB>0</SUB>=0.3, \\u03a9<SUB>\\u039b</SUB>=0.7, and h=1 and using SDSS Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using S\\u00e9rsic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the <SUP>0.1</SUP>r band, the best-fit Schechter function to our results has \\u03c6<SUB>*</SUB>=(1.49+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, M<SUB>*</SUB>-5log10h=-20.44+/-0.01, and \\u03b1=-1.05+/-0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in <SUP>0.1</SUP>r is (1.84+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>8</SUP> h L<SUB>0.1<SUB>r,solar</SUB></SUB> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. Our results in the <SUP>0.1</SUP>g band are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (~0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Though the details depend on their favorite galaxy formation theory, astronomers generally expect high redshift galaxies to be more luminous, smaller, bluer, and closer to exponential profiles than to de Vaucouleurs profiles, than are low redshift galaxies. Some of these predictions have been vindicated by observations of the Hubble Deep Fields and other surveys, such as the predominance of the blue population at high redshift. However, in order to distinguish between different galaxy formation theories, all of them require more consistent quantitative measurements than have yet been performed. In particular they require a consistent comparison to high quality low redshift surveys. We propose to perform just such a comparison to optical results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To perform this test carefully, we will analyze the instrumental effects on the comparison of low and high redshift objects, including the differences in resolution, signal-to-noise, rest-frame wavelengths, and background subtraction. By defining consistent measures of color, size and profile shape which are robust to these effects we will best be able to constrain galaxy formation theory. We will release to the community the software we develop and the simulated images we produce., Broadband measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measure different regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 10<SUP>6</SUP> spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55\\\" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92% for all targets, and greater than 99% for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90% (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys., Astrophysicists do not associate galaxies with the massive dark matter halos so easily detected in particle simulations and whose mass function can be predicted by the Press-Schechter formalism and its variants. Instead, they associate galaxies with smaller surviving subhalos whose contents do not fully mix into the larger dark matter halos they exist in. However, these subhalos are as of now difficult to find in simulations. I present a simple description of what the Press-Schechter formalism can say about the clustering of these subhalos, under the restrictive assumption that at fixed subhalo mass, the chance of survival of the subhalo is independent of its larger scale environment. This model predicts a weak dependence of clustering on mass below masses of about 10^12 solar masses, in agreement with observations of a weak dependence of clustering on luminosity at luminosities less than L*. The model is in qualitative agreement with observations that at low luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of color while at high luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of luminosity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

The collective behavior of plasmas that produce these emission signatures is still poorly understood. In order to allow modeling emission signatures from first principles, I construct radiative kinetic plasma simulations of these extreme plasma environments. In this talk I describe applications of these methods to understand the long-standing problem of the generation of coherent radio waves. I show that polar radio emission is directly produced by non-stationary plasma discharges in the polar cap. I also describe how mergers of magnetic islands in the reconnecting current sheet beyond the light cylinder can power high-power giant pulses and nano shots observed from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder., The discovery of pulsars opened a new research field that allows studying a wide range of physics under extreme conditions. More than 3,000 pulsars are currently known, including especially more than 200 of them studied at gamma-ray frequencies. By putting recent insights into the pulsar magnetosphere in a historical context and by comparing them to key observational features at radio and high-energy frequencies, we show the following: Magnetospheric structure of young energetic pulsars is now understood. Limitations still exist for old nonrecycled and millisecond pulsars. The observed high-energy radiation is likely produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. There are at least two different radio emission mechanisms. One operates in the inner magnetosphere, whereas the other one works near the light cylinder and is specific to pulsars with the high magnetic field strength in that region. Radio emission from the inner magnetosphere is intrinsically connected to the process of pair production, and its observed properties contain the imprint of both the geometry and propagation effects through the magnetospheric plasma.We discuss the limitations of our understanding and identify a range of observed phenomena and physical processes that still await explanation in thefuture. This includes connecting the magnetospheric processes to spin-down properties to explain braking and possible evolution of spin orientation, building a first-principles model of radio emission and quantitative connections with observations., A range of long-standing problems in black-hole astrophysics have recently become accessible to detailed investigation by the advent of general-relativistic and radiation methods for particle-based kinetic plasma simulations, as well as GPU-accelerated three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics codes. We propose to use our unique, state-ofthe- art computational tools to study (a) the behavior of black-hole magnetospheres in which plasma is supplied by self-consistent pair creation and radiative signatures of pair discharges near the event horizon; (b) dynamics and radiative output of reconnection-powered flares in magnetically arrested accretion flows; (c) the global evolution of accretion-disk coronae with both spacetime curvature and radiation effects, and (d) X-ray emission powered by radiative magnetic reconnection in the coronae of thin accretion disks. This research has broad relevance to NASA science, as it principally aims to understand X-ray and gamma-ray observations by Chandra, NuSTAR, and Fermi. We expect this work to have a broad impact on the field, from stimulating further technical developments in ever more realistic astrophysical plasma simulations, to aiding the interpretation of observations of individual sources., Accretion flows onto primary targets of the Event Horizon Telescope, M87* and SgrA*, consist of collisionless plasmas. It is yet unknown how microphysical instabilities in these plasmas affect the dynamics of the flow, and how non-thermal particles are produced during observed spectacular multi-wavelength flares. In this talk I will show results of first-principles two-dimensional general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations which address these fundamental questions. Large separation of microscopic (ion gyroradius) and macroscopic (black hole event horizon) scales in the simulation allows to probe the importance of mirror and firehose instabilities during the quiescent accretion, as well as the dynamics of magnetic reconnection and creation of electron-positron pair plasma in the flaring state., Since pulsars were discovered as emitters of bright coherent radio emission more than half a century ago, the cause of the emission has remained a mystery. In this Letter we demonstrate that coherent radiation can be directly generated in nonstationary pair plasma discharges which are responsible for filling the pulsar magnetosphere with plasma. By means of large-scale two-dimensional kinetic plasma simulations, we show that if pair creation is nonuniform across magnetic field lines, the screening of electric field by freshly produced pair plasma is accompanied by the emission of waves which are electromagnetic in nature. Using localized simulations of the screening process, we identify these waves as superluminal ordinary (O ) modes, which should freely escape from the magnetosphere as the plasma density drops along the wave path. The spectrum of the waves is broadband and the frequency range is comparable to that of observed pulsar radio emission., In this talk I will review the growing evidence of the importance of relativistic magnetic reconnection in powering observed emission from black holes and neutron stars. I will focus on the role of reconnection in accretion flows and jets from black holes and in magnetospheres of pulsars, magnetars and binary neutron stars before the merger., In this Letter we propose that coherent radio emission of the Crab pulsar, other young energetic pulsars, and millisecond pulsars is produced in the magnetospheric current sheet beyond the light cylinder. We carry out global and local 2D kinetic plasma simulations of reconnection to illustrate the coherent emission mechanism. Reconnection in the current sheet beyond the light cylinder proceeds in the very efficient plasmoid-dominated regime, where the current layer gets fragmented into a dynamic chain of plasmoids that undergo successive coalescence. Mergers of sufficiently large plasmoids produce secondary perpendicular current sheets, which are also plasmoid unstable. Collisions of plasmoids with each other and with the upstream magnetic field eject fast magnetosonic waves, which propagate upstream across the background field and successfully escape from the plasma as electromagnetic waves that fall in the radio band. This model successfully explains many important features of the observed radio emission from the Crab and other pulsars with high magnetic field at the light cylinder: phase coincidence with the high-energy emission, nanosecond duration (nanoshots), and extreme instantaneous brightness of individual pulses., We perform global particle-in-cell simulations of pulsar magnetospheres, including pair production, ion extraction from the surface, frame-dragging corrections, and high-energy photon emission and propagation. In the case of oblique rotators, the effects of general relativity increase the fraction of the open field lines that support active pair discharge. We find that the plasma density and particle energy flux in the pulsar wind are highly non-uniform with latitude. A significant fraction of the outgoing particle energy flux is carried by energetic ions, which are extracted from the stellar surface. Their energies may extend up to a large fraction of the open field line voltage, making them interesting candidates for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. We show that pulsar gamma-ray radiation is dominated by synchrotron emission, produced by particles that are energized by relativistic magnetic reconnection close to the Y-point and in the equatorial current sheet. In most cases, the calculated light curves contain two strong peaks, which is in general agreement with Fermi observations. The radiative efficiency decreases with increasing pulsar inclination and increasing efficiency of pair production in the current sheet, which explains the observed scatter in L <SUB> \\u03b3 </SUB> versus \\\\dot{E}. We find that the high-frequency cutoff in the spectra is regulated by the pair-loading of the current sheet. Our findings lay the foundation for quantitative interpretation of Fermi observations of gamma-ray pulsars., Radial transport of particles, elements and fluid driven by internal stresses in three-dimensional (3D) astrophysical accretion disks is an important phenomenon, potentially relevant for the outward dust transport in protoplanetary disks, origin of the refractory particles in comets, isotopic equilibration in the Earth-Moon system, etc. To gain better insight into these processes, we explore the dependence of meridional circulation in 3D disks with shear viscosity on their thermal stratification, and demonstrate a strong effect of the latter on the radial flow. Previous locally isothermal studies have normally found a pattern of the radial outflow near the midplane, switching to inflow higher up. Here we show, both analytically and numerically, that a flow that is inward at all altitudes is possible in disks with entropy and temperature steeply increasing with height. Such thermodynamic conditions may be typical in the optically thin, viscously heated accretion disks. Disks in which these conditions do not hold should feature radial outflow near the midplane, as long as their internal stress is provided by the shear viscosity. Our results can also be used for designing hydrodynamical disk simulations with a prescribed pattern of the meridional circulation., The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope greatly increased the number of known pulsars in the gamma-ray band. It was discovered that pulsars often emit a significant fraction of their spin-down energy in gamma-rays, offering a new powerful diagnostic tool of neutron star magnetic field structure. The modeling of gamma-ray data suggests that in order to interpret the observations one needs to understand the field geometry and the plasma state in the emission region. In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the magnetospheric structure in the limit of abundant plasma supply, the so-called force-free limit. I used force-free solutions to study the time evolution of the pulsar's obliquity angle. I showed that pulsar rotation and magnetic axes evolve toward alignment as a power-law in time, in broad agreement with observations. Despite the success of the force-free approach for understanding the global field geometry, the location of the emission region and radiation mechanism remained a mystery. To address this from first principles, in this thesis I developed kinetic three dimensional simulations of pulsar magnetospheres which include the physics of plasma production and particle acceleration. I found that the state of the magnetosphere crucially depends on the way charges are introduced into the magnetosphere. In simulations with self-consistent pair production I found several solutions with qualitatively different plasma distribution in the open field line region depending on the inclination of the pulsar. In a surprising finding, I discovered that GR effects help to establish efficient particle acceleration and pair production near the surface of low obliquity pulsars. Finally, I performed GR kinetic simulations of oblique rotators and showed that pulsar high-energy emission is dominated by synchrotron radiation emitted by particles that are energized by magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet. The computed lightcurves and spectra of high-energy emission reproduce the observed morphology of gamma-ray pulsars., Disk accretion at a high rate onto a white dwarf (WD) or a neutron star has been suggested to result in the formation of a spreading layer (SL)\\u2014a belt-like structure on the object's surface, in which the accreted matter steadily spreads in the poleward (meridional) direction while spinning down. To assess its basic characteristics, we perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic SLs in the relevant morphology with a simple prescription for cooling. We demonstrate that supersonic shear naturally present at the base of the SL inevitably drives sonic instability that gives rise to large-scale acoustic modes governing the evolution of the SL. These modes dominate the transport of momentum and energy, which is intrinsically global and cannot be characterized via some form of local effective viscosity (e.g., \\u03b1-viscosity). The global nature of the wave-driven transport should have important implications for triggering Type I X-ray bursts in low-mass X-ray binaries. The nonlinear evolution of waves into a system of shocks drives effective rearrangement (sensitively depending on thermodynamical properties of the flow) and deceleration of the SL, which ultimately becomes transonic and susceptible to regular Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We interpret this evolution in terms of the global structure of the SL and suggest that mixing of the SL material with the underlying stellar fluid should become effective only at intermediate latitudes on the accreting object's surface, where the flow has decelerated appreciably. In the near-equatorial regions the transport is dominated by acoustic waves and mixing is less efficient. We speculate that this latitudinal nonuniformity of mixing in accreting WDs may be linked to the observed bipolar morphology of classical nova ejecta., It has recently been demonstrated that self-consistent particle-in-cell simulations of low-obliquity pulsar magnetospheres in flat spacetime show weak particle acceleration and no pair production near the poles. We investigate the validity of this conclusion in a more realistic spacetime geometry via general-relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the aligned pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. We find that the addition of the frame-dragging effect makes the local current density along the magnetic field larger than the Goldreich-Julian value, which leads to unscreened parallel electric fields and the ignition of a pair cascade. When pair production is active, we observe field oscillations in the open field bundle, which could be related to pulsar radio emission. We conclude that general-relativistic effects are essential for the existence of the pulsar mechanism in low-obliquity rotators., We present \\u201cfirst-principles\\u201d relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of the oblique pulsar magnetosphere with pair formation. The magnetosphere starts to form with particles extracted from the surface of the neutron star. These particles are accelerated by surface electric fields and emit photons capable of producing electron-positron pairs. We inject secondary pairs at the locations of primary energetic particles whose energy exceeds the threshold for pair formation. We find solutions that are close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with the Y-point and current sheet. Solutions with obliquities \\u226440\\u00b0 do not show pair production in the open field line region because the local current density along the magnetic field is below the Goldreich-Julian value. The bulk outflow in these solutions is charge-separated, and pair formation happens in the current sheet and return current layer only. Solutions with higher inclinations show pair production in the open field line region, with high multiplicity of the bulk flow and the size of the pair-producing region increasing with inclination. We observe the spin-down of the star to be comparable to MHD model predictions. The magnetic dissipation in the current sheet ranges between 20% for the aligned rotator and 3% for the orthogonal rotator. Our results suggest that for low obliquity neutron stars with suppressed pair formation at the light cylinder, the presence of phenomena related to pair activity in the bulk of the polar region, e.g., radio emission, may crucially depend on the physics beyond our simplified model, such as the effects of curved spacetime or multipolar surface fields., The rotational period of isolated pulsars increases over time due to the extraction of angular momentum by electromagnetic torques. These torques also change the obliquity angle \\u03b1 between the magnetic and rotational axes. Although actual pulsar magnetospheres are plasma filled, the time evolution of \\u03b1 has mostly been studied for vacuum pulsar magnetospheres. In this work, we self-consistently account for the plasma effects for the first time by analysing the results of time-dependent 3D force-free and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of pulsar magnetospheres. We show that if a neutron star is spherically symmetric and is embedded with a dipolar magnetic moment, the pulsar evolves so as to minimize its spin-down luminosity: both vacuum and plasma-filled pulsars evolve towards the aligned configuration (\\u03b1 = 0). However, they approach the alignment in qualitatively different ways. Vacuum pulsars come into alignment exponentially fast, with \\u03b1 \\u221d exp (-t/\\u03c4) and \\u03c4 \\u223c spin-down time-scale. In contrast, we find that plasma-filled pulsars align much more slowly, with \\u03b1 \\u221d (t/\\u03c4)<SUP>-1/2</SUP>. We argue that the slow time evolution of obliquity of plasma-filled pulsars can potentially resolve several observational puzzles, including the origin of normal pulsars with periods of \\u223c1 s, the evidence that oblique pulsars come into alignment over a time-scale of \\u223c10<SUP>7</SUP> yr, and the observed deficit, relative to an isotropic obliquity distribution, of pulsars showing interpulse emission., We perform \\\"first-principles\\\" relativistic particle-in-cell simulations of aligned pulsar magnetosphere. We allow free escape of particles from the surface of a neutron star and continuously populate the magnetosphere with neutral pair plasma to imitate pair production. As pair plasma supply increases, we observe the transition from a charge-separated \\\"electrosphere\\\" solution with trapped plasma and no spin-down to a solution close to the ideal force-free magnetosphere with electromagnetically dominated pulsar wind. We calculate the magnetospheric structure, current distribution, and spin-down power of the neutron star. We also discuss particle acceleration in the equatorial current sheet., The eclipsing binary DI Herculis (DI Her) is known to exhibit anomalously slow apsidal precession below the rate predicted by general relativity. Recent measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate that stellar spins in DI Her are almost orthogonal to the orbital angular momentum, which explains the anomalous precession in agreement with the earlier theoretical suggestion by Shakura. However, these measurements yield only projections of the spin-orbit angles onto the sky plane, leaving the spin projection onto our line of sight unconstrained. Here we describe a method for determining the full three-dimensional spin orientation of the binary components relying on the use of the gravity-darkening effect, which is significant for the rapidly rotating stars in DI Her. Gravity darkening gives rise to a nonuniform brightness distribution over the stellar surface, the pattern of which depends on the stellar spin orientation. Using archival photometric data obtained during multiple eclipses over several decades, we are able to constrain the unknown spin angles in DI Her with this method, finding that the spin axes of both stars lie close to the plane of the sky. Our procedure fully accounts for the precession of stellar spins over the long time span of observations.\",\n          \"DASCH (Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard) is the effort to digitize the majority of the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) Astronomical Photographic Glass Plate Collection, a set of ~550,000 images of the night sky spanning more than a century of observations. With the support of HCO, DASCH scanning is resuming after a hiatus of more than two years. At the time of the writing of this abstract (late September, 2023), scanning is 96% complete with an estimated ~6 months required to finish. Efforts are underway to make the complete DASCH lightcurve collection available for analysis, enhancing a unique resource for time-domain astrophysics. Work is also ongoing to expose the full richness of the collection in a sophisticated web interface that will interlink the scientific data with archival and historical information, centering the \\\"women astronomical computers\\\" without whose work this irreplaceable scientific asset would not exist. I will report the current status of the scanning effort, DASCH data availability, and the new web portal., In the Jupyter ecosystem, data visualization is usually done with \\\"widgets\\\" created as notebook cell outputs. While this mechanism works well in some circumstances, it is not well-suited to presenting interfaces that are long-lived, interactive, and visually rich. Unlike the traditional Jupyter notebook system, the newer JupyterLab application provides a sophisticated extension infrastructure that raises new design possibilities. Here we present a novel user experience (UX) for interactive data visualization in JupyterLab that is based on an \\\"app\\\" that runs alongside the user's notebooks, rather than widgets that are bound inside them. We have implemented this UX for the AAS WorldWide Telescope (WWT) visualization tool. JupyterLab's messaging APIs allow the app to smoothly exchange data with multiple computational kernels, allowing users to accomplish tasks that are not possible using the widget framework. A new Jupyter server extension allows the frontend to request data from kernels asynchronously over HTTP, enabling interactive exploration of gigapixel-scale imagery in WWT. While we have developed this UX for WWT, the overall design and the server extension are portable to other applications and have the potential to unlock a variety of new user activities that aren't currently possible in \\\"science platform\\\" interfaces., The principal data set on which this study is based is the 2019 data Release of the NEOWISE-R survey. The wavelengths of the W1 and W2 bands, 3.4 and 4.6\\u03bcm, are well placed for observing T<SUB>g</SUB>~1000-K circumstellar dust emission. The instrument has the sensitivity to cover the fainter and heavily reddened WR stars found in recent IR surveys, e.g. Mauerhan, Van Dyk &amp; Morris (2009PASP..121..591M), Shara et al. (2009AJ....138..402S) but, on the other hand, most of the WR dust emitters found in the earlier studies are too bright for NEOWISE-R, so there is little overlap with the earlier studies. <P />The observations were taken between late 2013 and late 2018. The cadence of the observations makes them most useful for studying variations over short (~1-2d) and long (~1-5yr) time-scales, of which the latter are of interest for the present investigation. <P />The NEOWISE-R Single Exposure Source Data base in the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) data were searched at the positions of all WC stars in V1.22 (http://pacrowther.staff.shef.ac.uk/WRcat/index.php, dated 2019 March) of the Galactic WR Catalogue (Rosslowe &amp; Crowther 2015MNRAS.447.2322R). <P />(19 data files)., Fast empirical models of the broad emission line region (BLR) are a powerful tool to interpret velocity-resolved reverberation mapping (RM) data, estimate the mass of the supermassive black holes, and gain insight into its geometry and kinematics. Much of the effort so far has been devoted to describing the emissivity of one emission line at a time. We present here an alternative approach aimed at describing the underlying BLR gas distribution, by exploiting simple numerical recipes to connect it with emissivity. This approach is a step toward describing multiple emission lines originating from the same gas and allows us to clarify some issues related to the interpretation of RM data. We illustrate this approach-implemented in the code CARAMEL-GAS-using three data sets covering the H\\u03b2 emission line (Mrk 50, Mrk 1511, Arp 151) that have been modeled using the emissivity-based version of the code. As expected, we find differences in the parameters describing the BLR gas and emissivity distribution, but the emissivity-weighted lag measurements and all other model parameters including black hole mass and overall BLR morphology and kinematics are consistent with the previous measurements. We also model the H\\u03b1 emission line for Arp 151 using both the gas- and emissivity-based BLR models. We find ionization stratification in the BLR with H\\u03b1 arising at larger radii than H\\u03b2, while all other model parameters are consistent within the uncertainties., In the solar system, planetary magnetospheres are universally associated with trapped energetic charged particles. This suggests that such magnetospheric systems should be prevalent in the broader universe as well, and that we might be able to probe them with radio astronomical observations. Amidst the ongoing bonanza of exoplanetary discoveries, current observatories are unfortunately not expected to be able to detect Jupiter analogues, let alone terrestrial planets. But it turns out that radio astronomers do detect radio signals from ultracool dwarfs the very smallest stars, brown dwarfs, and planetary-mass objects that indicate the presence of planet-like magnetospheres that are stable, dipole-dominated, and luminous in gyrosynchrotron and cyclotron maser emission. I will present radio studies of some of the most spectacular of these radio-active objects, where the extremely rich data require far more sophisticated emission modeling than astronomers typically employ. Because these objects are free-floating and may have masses dozens of times that of Jupiter with rotation periods less than two hours, understanding their radio emission should yield new insights into dynamo physics and the processes driving radiation belt energization., , We present the first ever models of a broad line region (BLR) at the peak of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity using the multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745. The modeled data consist of monthly spectra covering the broad C IV emission line over a 5.3 yr baseline. The models suggest a thick disk BLR that is inclined by ~40\\u00b0 to the observer's line of sight and with an emissivity weighted median radius of ${r}_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={33.0}_{-2.1}^{+2.4}$ light days. The kinematics are dominated by near-circular Keplerian motion with the remainder inflowing. The rest-frame lag one would measure from the models is ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{median}}={36.4}_{-1.8}^{+1.8}$ days, which is consistent with measurements based on cross-correlation. We show a possible geometry and transfer function based on the model fits and find that the model-produced velocity-resolved lags are consistent with those from cross-correlation. We measure a black hole mass of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={8.31}_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ , which requires a scale factor of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })={0.20}_{-0.07}^{+0.09}$ . This is the most precise M<SUB>BH</SUB> measurement for any AGN at cosmological distances and it demonstrates that the precision required for BH-host coevolution studies is attainable., Candidates were observed using the Near-Infrared Camera 2 (NIRC2), the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI), the OH-Suppressing InfraRed Imaging Spectrograph (OSIRIS), and the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) at Keck Observatory; the ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (EFOSC2) at the New Technology Telescope; and the Adaptive Optics Module and Goodman Spectrograph at the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope. In this campaign, we observed 56 total candidates (Table 1), including three new lenses and one known lens. <P />(1 data file)., The HERA Librarian system keeps track of all the primary data products for the telescope at a given site. The Librarian supports large data volumes and automated data processing capabilities. A web-based application handles human user and automatic requests and interfaces with a backing database and data storage servers. The system supports the long-term data storage of all relevant telescope data, as well as staging data to individual users' directories for processing., We present the first results of a 4.5 yr monitoring campaign of the three bright images of multiply imaged z = 2.805 quasar SDSS J2222+2745 using the Gemini North Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Nordic Optical Telescope. We take advantage of gravitational time delays to construct light curves surpassing 6 yr in duration in the observed frame and achieve an average spectroscopic cadence of 10 days during the 8 months of visibility per season. Using multiple secondary calibrators and advanced reduction techniques, we achieve percent-level spectrophotometric precision and carry out an unprecedented reverberation mapping analysis, measuring both integrated and velocity-resolved time lags for the C IV emission line. The full line lags the continuum by ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={36.5}_{-3.9}^{+2.9}$ rest-frame days. We combine our measurement with published C IV emission line lags and derive the r<SUB>BLR</SUB> - L relationship ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}(\\\\tau /{\\\\rm{d}}{\\\\rm{a}}{\\\\rm{y}})=(0.99\\\\,\\\\pm 0.07)+(0.48\\\\pm 0.03){\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}[\\\\lambda {L}_{\\\\lambda }(1350\\\\,{\\\\rm{A}}{\\\\rm{A}})/{10}^{44}\\\\,{{\\\\rm{e}}{\\\\rm{r}}{\\\\rm{g}}{\\\\rm{s}}}^{-1}]$ with 0.30 \\u00b1 0.06 dex intrinsic scatter. The velocity-resolved lags are consistent with circular Keplerian orbits, with ${\\\\tau }_{\\\\mathrm{cen}}={86.2}_{-5.0}^{+4.5}$ , ${25}_{-15}^{+11}$ , and ${7.5}_{-3.5}^{+4.2}$ rest-frame days for the core, blue wing, and red wing, respectively. Using \\u03c3<SUB>line</SUB> with the mean spectrum and assuming ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({f}_{\\\\mathrm{mean},\\\\sigma })=0.52\\\\pm 0.26$ , we derive ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })=8.63\\\\pm 0.27$ . Given the quality of the data, this system represents a unique benchmark for calibration of M<SUB>BH</SUB> estimators at high redshift. Future work will present dynamical modeling of the data to constrain the virial factor f and M<SUB>BH</SUB>., There is overwhelming evidence for a link between supermassive black holes (BHs) and their host galaxies, yet the physical mechanisms behind the connection are poorly understood. Discerning between possible co-evolutionary scenarios requires precise measurements of BH masses and host properties across cosmic time. BH mass measurements outside the local universe require bright active galactic nuclei (AGNs), but the AGN light overwhelms the light of the host, making host property measurements difficult. Further, BH mass estimates rely on the unresolvable broad emission line region (BLR), and the unknown nature of the BLR limits their precision. <P />In this dissertation, I use a unique combination of gravitational lensing and reverberation mapping techniques to tackle both issues. First, I present a semi-supervised classification approach for identifying rare lensed quasars based solely on photometry in wide-field surveys. Lenses are powerful tools for measuring host properties, but studies are limited by the small sample size, so discovery efforts are crucial. Using this technique, I successfully discovered three new lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with several other candidates awaiting further follow-up. This approach is flexible and can easily be modified to target specific types of lenses as well as lenses in surveys covering different portions of the sky. <P />Next, I use a modeling framework to measure precise BH masses for seven AGNs and infer the structural and kinematic properties of the H\\u03b1 BLR. This nearly doubles the sample size of modeled BLRs, allowing for a correlation analysis between BLR properties and AGN observables that can be used to improve BH mass measurements for all AGNs. I then model H\\u03b1, CIV, and Lya in NGC 5548 using data from 85 Hubble Space Telescope orbits and multiple ground-based telescopes to understand the similarities and differences between the optical and UV BLRs. High-z BH mass measurements rely on UV lines, but our current understanding of the UV BLR is severely lacking, so understanding their connection is critical for decreasing high-z BH mass uncertainties. Finally, I tie the previous projects together with the most precise high-z BH mass measurement to date, using data from a 4.5 year monitoring campaign of a strongly lensed quasar at z = 2.805. Accounting for gravitational time delays, the campaign exceeds 6 years in duration. Understanding the co-evolution of BHs and their hosts will require measurements of this precision at high-z, and this research demonstrates that gravitational lensing makes this level of precision obtainable., We present geometric and dynamical modeling of the broad line region (BLR) for the multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign focused on NGC 5548 in 2014. The data set includes photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical and ultraviolet, covering the H\\u03b2, C IV, and Ly\\u03b1 broad emission lines. We find an extended disk-like H\\u03b2 BLR with a mixture of near-circular and outflowing gas trajectories, while the C IV and Ly\\u03b1 BLRs are much less extended and resemble shell-like structures. There is clear radial structure in the BLR, with C IV the three lines, we make three independent black hole mass measurements, all of which are consistent. Combining these results gives a joint inference of ${\\\\mathrm{log}}_{10}({M}_{\\\\mathrm{BH}}/{M}_{\\\\odot })={7.64}_{-0.18}^{+0.21}$ . We examine the effect of using the V band instead of the UV continuum light curve on the results and find a size difference that is consistent with the measured UV-optical time lag, but the other structural and kinematic parameters remain unchanged, suggesting that the V band is a suitable proxy for the ionizing continuum when exploring the BLR structure and kinematics. Finally, we compare the H\\u03b2 results to similar models of data obtained in 2008 when the active galactic nucleus was at a lower luminosity state. We find that the size of the emitting region increased during this time period, but the geometry and black hole mass remained unchanged, which confirms that the BLR kinematics suitably gauge the gravitational field of the central black hole., Electronic publishing opens the possibility of conveying scientific content using visualisations that are interactive and exploratory, not just static images. The American Astronomical Society, publisher of the Astrophysical Journal and others, has been working to promote the use of \\\"interactive figures\\\" in its journals as part of a broader effort to keep its offerings on the technical forefront. This year, the AAS is launching new tools to ease the creation of interactive figures for two common data types: time series, using a new AAS Timeseries Tool, and sky images, using the AAS WorldWide Telescope. This item gives an overview of these tools and how you can start using them to share your data in a new, rich way., We finalize our tests of the Gaussian mixture model by examining how it classifies known lenses. Of a list of known lenses, 128 lie in the SDSS footprint for which we can obtain colours and calculate membership probabilities (table 2). <P />&gt;From our visual inspection scores, we have 43 objects with score greater than 1.5, after eliminating all contaminants based on the spectroscopic information. These are listed in Table 3 <P />(2 data files)., Photometry at 3.4 and 4.6 {\\u03bc m} of 128 Population I WC type Wolf-Rayet stars in the Galaxy and 12 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) observed in the WISE NEOWISE-R survey was searched for evidence of circumstellar dust emission and its variation. Infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) were assembled, making use of archival r, i, Z, and Y photometry to determine reddening and stellar wind levels for the WC stars found in recent IR surveys and lacking optical photometry. From their SEDs, 10 apparently non-variable stars were newly identified as dust makers, including three, WR 102-22, WR 110-10, and WR 124-10, having subtype earlier than WC8-9, the first such stars to show this phenomenon. The 11 stars found to show variable dust emission include six new episodic dust makers, WR 47c, WR 75-11, WR 91-1, WR 122-14, and WR 125-1 in the Galaxy and HD 38030 in the LMC. Of previously known dust makers, NEOWISE-R photometry of WR 19 captured its rise to maximum in 2018 confirming the 10.1-yr period, that of WR 125 the beginning of a new episode of dust formation suggesting a period near 28.3 yr. while that of HD 36402 covered almost a whole period and forced revision of it to 5.1 yr., , We present models of the H\\u03b2-emitting broad-line region (BLR) in seven Seyfert 1 galaxies from the Lick AGN Monitoring Project 2011 sample, drawing inferences on the BLR structure and dynamics as well as the mass of the central supermassive black hole. We find that the BLR is generally a thick disk, viewed close to face-on, with preferential emission back toward the ionizing source. The dynamics in our sample range from near-circular elliptical orbits to inflowing or outflowing trajectories. We measure black hole masses of {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({M}<SUB>BH</SUB>}/{M}<SUB>\\u2299 </SUB>)={6.48}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.21</SUP> for PG 1310-108, {7.50}<SUB>-0.18</SUB><SUP>+0.25</SUP> for Mrk 50, {7.46}<SUB>-0.21</SUB><SUP>+0.15</SUP> for Mrk 141, {7.58}<SUB>-0.08</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP> for Mrk 279, {7.11}<SUB>-0.17</SUB><SUP>+0.20</SUP> for Mrk 1511, {6.65}<SUB>-0.15</SUB><SUP>+0.27</SUP> for NGC 4593, and {6.94}<SUB>-0.14</SUB><SUP>+0.14</SUP> for Zw 229-015. We use these black hole mass measurements along with cross-correlation time lags and line widths to recover the scale factor f used in traditional reverberation mapping measurements. Combining our results with other studies that use this modeling technique, which brings our sample size to 16, we calculate a scale factor that can be used for measuring black hole masses in other reverberation mapping campaigns. When using the root-mean-square (rms) spectrum and using the line dispersion to measure the line width, we find {log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>rms</SUB>,\\u03c3 }) <SUB>pred</SUB> = 0.57 \\u00b1 0.19. Finally, we search for correlations between f and other AGN and BLR parameters and find marginal evidence that f is correlated with M <SUB>BH</SUB> and the BLR inclination angle, but no significant evidence of a correlation with the AGN luminosity or Eddington ratio., Low-frequency radio observations are believed to represent one of the few means of directly probing the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets. However, a half-century of low-frequency planetary observations within the Solar System demonstrate that detailed, physically-motivated magnetospheric models are needed to properly interpret the radio data. I will present recent work in this area focusing on the current state of the art: relatively high-frequency observations of relatively massive objects, which are now understood to have magnetospheres that are largely planetary in nature. I will highlight the key challenges that will arise in future space-based observations of lower-mass objects at lower frequencies., We present the discovery of three quasar lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using two novel photometry-based selection techniques. The J0941+0518 system, with two point sources separated by 5.46 arcsec on either side of a galaxy, has source and lens redshifts 1.54 and 0.343. Images of J2257+2349 show two point sources separated by 1.67 arcsec on either side of an E/S0 galaxy. The extracted spectra show two images of the same quasar at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.10. SDSS J1640+1045 has two quasar spectra at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.70 and fits to the SDSS and Pan-STARRS images confirm the presence of a galaxy between the two point sources. We observed 56 photometrically selected lens candidates in this follow-up campaign, confirming three new lenses, re-discovering one known lens, and ruling out 36 candidates, with 16 still inconclusive. This initial campaign demonstrates the power of purely photometric selection techniques in finding lensed quasars., I discuss three mutually-supportive notions or assumptions regarding jets and accretion. The first is magnetocentrifugal acceleration (MCA), the overwhelmingly favored mechanism for the production of jets in most steady accreting systems. The second is the zero-torque inner boundary condition. The third is that effective viscous dissipation is like real dissipation, leading directly to heating. All three assumptions fit nicely together in a manner that is simple, persuasive, and mutually-consistent. All, I argue, are incorrect. For concreteness I focus on protostars. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in accretion is not a sink of energy, but a reservoir, capable of doing mechanical work directly and therefore efficiently, rather than solely through ohmic (\\\"viscous\\\") heating. Advection of turbulence energy reduces the effective radiative efficiency, and may help solve the missing boundary-layer emission problem. The angular momentum problem, whereby accretion spins up a protostar to breakup, is resolved by allowing direct viscous coupling to the protostar, permitting substantially greater energy to be deposited into the accretion flow than otherwise possible. This goes not into heat, but into a turbulent, tangled, buoyant toroidal magnetic field. I argue that there is neither an angular momentum problem nor an efficiency problem that MCA is needed to solve. Moreover, the turbulent magnetic field has ample ability not just to collimate but to accelerate gas, first radially inwards through tension forces and then vertically through pressure forces, without any MCA mechanism. I suggest then that jets, particularly the most powerful and well-collimated protostellar jets, are not magnetocentrifugally driven., The lowest mass brown dwarfs can, surprisingly, generate magnetic fields with kilogauss strengths, comparable to those of the most active M dwarfs. However their associated magnetic phenomenology is very different, with strong radio emission that has defied detailed interpretation thus far. I argue that these objects are best understood as scaled-up Jupiters, possessing rotation-dominated magnetospheres, rather than scaled-down stars. I present a new, publicly-available numerical model, \\\"vernon\\\", inspired by ones used to analyze the terrestrial and Jovian magnetospheres. Components include a steady-state Fokker-Planck solver, fast and accurate calculation of full-Stokes synchrotron radiative transfer coefficients, and fully polarized 3D radiative transfer integration. This new model finally makes it possible to relate the data to the detailed physical characteristics of these objects' magnetospheres., The photometric capabilities of the Helioseismic Imager aboard STEREO\\u2019s Ahead spacecraft (HI1A) have allowed the yearly observation of a large number of stars situated near the ecliptic over the past decade. While many reliable stellar variability analyses have been performed, unwanted artifacts may still exist in the data that sometimes manifest as false signals. Between May 22 and July 1, 2016, Kepler\\u2019s K2 mission executed the second part of Guest Observer Campaign 9 to study gravitational microlensing events in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Coincidentally, during approximately two weeks of this campaign, HI1A was directed toward the same field of view, presenting a rare opportunity to compare the contemporaneous observations from both instruments looking at the same set of stars. Utilizing the high sensitivity of Kepler, undesirable artifacts within the observed HI1A photometric signals may be identified and removed. Additionally, intrinsic variations of these field stars, such as those with long periodicities, may be confirmed by calibrating the signals from HI1A with those from Kepler. These stars may subsequently undergo retrospective analyses using the available data from STEREO, which will provide further insights into their variability characteristics., The 2001 discovery of radio emission from ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), the very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs with spectral types of \\u223cM7 and later, revealed that these objects can generate and dissipate powerful magnetic fields. Radio observations provide unparalleled insight into UCD magnetism: detections extend to brown dwarfs with temperatures &lt;math xmlns:xlink=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\\\"&gt; &lt;mo&gt;\\u2272&lt;/mo&gt; \\\\lesssim 1000 K, where no other observational probes are effective. The data reveal that UCDs can generate strong (kG) fields, sometimes with a stable dipolar structure; that they can produce and retain nonthermal plasmas with electron acceleration extending to MeV energies; and that they can drive auroral current systems resulting in significant atmospheric energy deposition and powerful, coherent radio bursts. Still to be understood are the underlying dynamo processes, the precise means by which particles are accelerated around these objects, the observed diversity of magnetic phenomenologies, and how all of these factors change as the mass of the central object approaches that of Jupiter. The answers to these questions are doubly important because UCDs are both potential exoplanet hosts, as in the TRAPPIST-1 system, and analogues of extrasolar giant planets themselves., ``Ultracool'' stars and brown dwarfs (cooler than 2700 K, spectral types M7 and later) are now known to be capable of generating and dissipating strong (kG) magnetic fields. Intriguingly, both observations and theory suggest that the dynamo process that drives the magnetic activity of these objects may in fact be bistable, operating in either a ``star-like'' or ``planet-like'' mode. Data that can further test this hypothesis are, however, scarce. In the past year, eight new cold (&lt;1500 K) brown dwarfs have been confirmed to be magnetically active from radio observations. Here we propose Chandra observations to test the bimodality hypothesis by investigating the ratios of their radio and X-ray luminosities, which distinguish the star-like and planet-like modes., We observed the position of the optical counterpart SSS17a (Coulter et al., LVC 21529) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) on 2017 August 19 UT and 2017 August 26 UT. Each observation lasted 20 minutes and was performed using ALMA's Band 3, with spectral windows of 4 GHz bandwidth centered at 91.5 and 103.5 GHz. We have analyzed the data using a custom CASA-based pipeline. At a mean frequency of 97.5 GHz, we detect no emission at the location of the optical transient to a combined 3-sigma limit of 50 microJy. We detect a source with a preliminary flux density of ~0.2 mJy at the location: RA = 13:09:47.696 dec = -23:23:02.31 with a positional uncertainty of ~0.04 arcsec. This is consistent with the optical position of the host galaxy and the position of the radio source reported by Alexander et al. (LVC 21545) and others. We thank the ALMA staff, especially Tony Remijan, for their excellent support., We investigated observations of the candidate optical counterpart to LIGO/Virgo trigger G298048 in the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) data archive. The field containing the candidate was observed at both 1.51 GHz (\\\"L band\\\") and 4.89 GHz (\\\"C band\\\") on June 10 and 23, 1984, as part of program AW0110. The on-source integration times were 11.5 and 5.5 minutes, respectively. We obtained images generated by the NRAO's VLA/AIPS data calibration pipeline (L. Sjouwerman, in preparation), which automatically processed the data in 2009. We see no persuasive evidence for radio emission at the location of either the host galaxy or the counterpart candidates. We measure image RMS values of ~180 and ~340 microJy near the candidates in the 1.51 and 4.89 GHz images, respectively. Taking a flux density upper limit of three times the RMS and a luminosity distance of 39.5 Mpc, these values correspond to upper limits on the spectral luminosity of 10^27.0 and 10^27.3 erg/s/Hz at 1.51 and 4.89 GHz. Using the relation between synchrotron emission and star formation rate presented by Yun &amp; Carilli (2002 ApJ 568 88), the implied star formation rate of the candidate host galaxy is less than 0.05 solar masses per year. For comparison, Alexander et al. (LVC GCNs 21545, 21548) report a VLA radio detection of 300 microJy at 9.77 GHz, and Bannister et al. (LVC GCN 21559) report ATCA radio detections of 600-400 microJy at 8.5--21.2 GHz. These values are consistent with the archival limits., HERA, the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, is a long wavelength radio telescope under construction in South Africa. Although HERA's primary science driver is the search for radio signatures of the Epoch of Reionization, its large collecting area, excellent calibratability, and methodical observing scheme make it a world-class tool for time-domain radio astronomy as well. In particlar, the completed HERA array will be sensitive to auroral radio bursts from planets with auroral powers and magnetic field strengths comparable to (factors of a few larger than) those of Jupiter, assuming a fiducial distance of 10 pc. HERA will log thousands of hours monitoring the stellar systems in its sky footprint, including the 40 systems found within this fiducial horizon. In this talk I will describe the current status of HERA and its future prospects for directly detecting exoplanetary magnetospheres., Wide-field photometric surveys enable searches of rare yet interesting objects, such as strongly lensed quasars or quasars with a bright host galaxy. Past searches for lensed quasars based on their optical and near-infrared properties have relied on photometric cuts and spectroscopic preselection (as in the Sloan Quasar Lens Search), or neural networks applied to photometric samples. These methods rely on cuts in morphology and colours, with the risk of losing many interesting objects due to scatter in their population properties, restrictive training sets, systematic uncertainties in catalogue-based magnitudes and survey-to-survey photometric variations. Here, we explore the performance of a Gaussian mixture model to separate point-like quasars, quasars with an extended host and strongly lensed quasars using griz &lt;monospace&gt;psf&lt;/monospace&gt; and &lt;monospace&gt;model&lt;/monospace&gt; magnitudes and WISE W1, W2. The choice of optical magnitudes is due to their presence in all current and upcoming releases of wide-field surveys, whereas UV information is not always available. We then assess the contamination from blue galaxies and the role of additional features such as W3 magnitudes or &lt;monospace&gt;psf-model&lt;/monospace&gt; terms as morphological information. As a demonstration, we conduct a search in a random 10 per cent of the SDSS footprint, and provide the catalogue of the 43 SDSS object with the highest 'lens' score in our selection that survive visual inspection, and are spectroscopically confirmed to host active nuclei. We inspect archival data and find images of 5/43 objects in the Hubble Legacy Archive, including two known lenses. The code and materials are available to facilitate follow-up., pwkit is a collection of miscellaneous astronomical utilities in Python, with an emphasis on radio astronomy, reading and writing various data formats, and convenient command-line utilities. Utilities include basic astronomical calculations, data visualization tools such as mapping arbitrary data to color scales and tracing contours, and data input and output utilities such as streaming output from other programs., Route &amp; Wolszczan (2016) recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 brown dwarf WISEP J112254.7+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of ~17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission possibly with a period of 116 minutes, although our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to confirm it. Our proposed periodicity is typical of other radio-active ultracool dwarfs. The handedness of the circular polarization alternates with time and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Route &amp; Wolszczan recently detected five radio bursts from the T6 dwarf WISEP J112254.73+255021.5 and used the timing of these events to propose that this object rotates with an ultra-short period of \\u223c17.3 minutes. We conducted follow-up observations with the Very Large Array and Gemini-North but found no evidence for this periodicity. We do, however, observe variable, highly circularly polarized radio emission. Assuming that the radio emission of this T dwarf is periodically variable on \\u223chour timescales, like other radio-active ultracool dwarfs, we infer a likely period of 116 minutes. However, our observation lasted only 162 minutes and so more data are needed to test this hypothesis. The handedness of the circular polarization switches twice and there is no evidence for any unpolarized emission component, the first time such a phenomenology has been observed in radio studies of very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. We suggest that the object\\u2019s magnetic dipole axis may be highly misaligned relative to its rotation axis., Radio studies show that, despite their low temperatures, very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs can generate strong magnetic fields and accelerate ~MeV electrons. Strikingly, the resulting phenomenology resembles that of a scaled- up planet more than a scaled-down star, with aurorae and radiation belts thousands of times brighter than those of Jupiter. In both Jupiter and the \\\"ultracool dwarfs,\\\" radio emission traces energetic magnetospheric electrons. In Jupiter, many of these electrons eventually crash into the upper atmosphere, their energy driving haze production and vertical mixing. We do not know how efficiently magnetic energy is deposited in ultracool dwarf atmospheres, or the chemistry that this drives. This deposition leads to FUV emission, however, and we have recently calculated that the most radio-active ultracool dwarf, NLTT33370B, should produce enough FUV to be detectable with Hubble. We propose a 4-hour simultaneous VLA/HST observation to measure the impact of this deposition process. Using a novel VLA sub-arraying tactic, we will leverage well-vetted planetary radiation belt models to obtain an unprecendently detailed view of how electrons migrate through this dwarfs's inner magnetosphere. Hubble will probe their ultimate fate., The z ~ 0.5 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 has been proposed as the host of a radio transient associated with FRB 150418 (Keane et al., 2016 Nature 530 453)., Keane et al. have recently claimed to have obtained the first precise localization for a fast radio burst (FRB) thanks to the identification of a contemporaneous fading slow (\\u223cweek-timescale) radio transient. They use this localization to pinpoint the FRB to a galaxy at z\\u2248 0.49 that exhibits no discernible star formation activity. We argue that the transient is not genuine and that the host candidate, WISE J071634.59-190039.2, is instead a radio variable: the available data did not exclude this possibility; a random radio variable consistent with the observations is not unlikely to have a redshift compatible with the FRB dispersion measure; and the proposed transient light curve is better explained as a scintillating steady source, perhaps also showing an active galactic nucleus (AGN) flare, than a synchrotron-emitting blastwave. The radio luminosity of the host candidate implies that it is an AGN and we present new late-time Very Large Array observations showing that the galaxy is indeed variable at a level consistent with the claimed transient. Therefore the claimed precise localization and redshift determination for FRB 150418 cannot be justified., Keane et al. (2016 Nature 530 453) reported a fading radio transient in the z=0.498 galaxy WISE J071634.59-190039.2 (WISE 0716-19; Williams &amp; Berger, arxiv:1602.08434) that they associated with the fast radio burst FRB 150418., Twenty-five years ago, Pringle suggested a boundary-layer origin for jets from YSOs. The jets were driven by a toroidal magnetic field generated by strong shear in the accretion boundary layer. Such a mechanism is clearly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature.Nearly fifteen years ago, we suggested a cartoon of the jet-launching mechanism in protostars in which shear, acting upon MHD turbulence generated by the magnetorotational instability (MRI), generated a tangled, toroidal magnetic field capable of driving a jet. This picture, which is also manifestly non-magnetocentrifugal in nature, relied upon a novel model for MRI-driven MHD turbulence based on a viscoelastic, rather than a viscous, prescription for the turbulent stress. Our hypothesis has some clear similarities to Pringle's mechanism, but it relied upon a large envelope surrounding the central star.An accretion boundary layer has long been recognized as a promising source for protostellar jets in good part because in a standard thin disk, matter loses circa half of all its accretion energy in this layer, but it is problematic to drive a well-collimated outflow from a boundary layer in a thin disk. In this presentation, we argue paradoxically that the \\\"boundary layer\\\" can drive jets when a true boundary layer, like the thin disk, does not exist. This changes the inner boundary condition for viscous angular momentum flux in the disk.The standard argument for a thin boundary layer is, we argue, circular. In high accretion-rate systems, or when the gas cannot cool efficiently, there is no reason to suspect the turbulent viscosity in this boundary layer to be small, and therefore neither is the boundary layer. When the boundary layer becomes larger than the central accretor itself, it is arguably no longer a boundary layer, but rather an envelope. It is still, however, a substantial source of power and toroidal MRI-driven magnetic fields.It is, again, only in relatively hot or high-accretion rate systems in which the boundary layer would be expected to inflate and so disappear. Not coincidentally, it is in such systems, such as Class 0 and Class I protostars, in which we have the strongest evidence for powerful, well-collimated jet outflows., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b. While the first efforts were admittedly optimistic, long-wavelength radio arrays are finally achieving sensitivities comparable to the expected signal, and the pace of investment has been quickening as groups compete to make the first conclusive detection of radio emission from an exoplanet. I describe current survey efforts and their potential payoff: radio observations can yield measurements of otherwise inaccessible quantities such as rotation periods and magnetic moments, the latter being particularly relevant to habitability and star/planet interactions. I argue that the under-construction Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array, HERA, will be a particularly powerful instrument in these studies., Motivated by the bright and phenomenologically-rich auroral radio bursts observed in the Solar System, astronomers have been attempting to detect exoplanets at radio wavelengths since before the discovery of 51 Peg b.

Here we report its detection with ALMA at 95 GHz at a mean flux density of 56 \\u00b1 12 \\u03bcJy, making it the first ultracool dwarf detected in the millimeter band, excluding young, disk-bearing objects. We also report flux density measurements from unpublished archival VLA data and new optical monitoring data from the Liverpool Telescope. The ALMA data are consistent with a power-law radio spectrum that extends continuously between centimeter and millimeter wavelengths. We argue that the emission is due to the synchrotron process, excluding thermal, free-free, and electron cyclotron maser emission as possible sources. During the interval of the ALMA observation that phases with the maximum of the object\\u2019s optical variability, the flux density is higher at a \\u223c1.8\\u03c3 significance level. These early results show how ALMA opens a new window for studying the magnetic activity of ultracool dwarfs, particularly shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanism operating in their immediate surroundings., Ultracool dwarfs (spectral types &gt;M7) were long expected to be magnetically inactive, but concerted X-ray and radio observations (mostly by our group) have led to the discovery of magnetic activity and a characterization of its basic properties. We have recently discovered periodic radio bursts from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS 1047+21, by far the coolest (900 K) substellar object detected in the radio, implying high levels of magnetic activity well into the brown dwarf regime and making it a uniquely compelling target in the challenging search for ultracool X-ray emission. We propose a 40 ks observation with ACIS-S and the VLA that will cover 6 full rotations, place the deepest constraints on X-ray luminosity to date, and may lead to the first detection of X-ray emission from a T dwarf., The relationship between stellar rotation and magnetic activity is important to understand because it has implications for exoplanetary habitability, measuring stellar ages, and the nature of the stellar dynamo. The physics underlying this relationship, however, are far from clear. New rotation period measurements in a large sample of well-characterized, nearby M dwarfs from the MEarth project reach new areas of parameter space and offer an opportunity to gain insight if paired with X-ray observations. We propose 22 objects for study (14 with Chandra, 8 with Swift): 17 with short rotation periods, settling whether \\\"supersaturation\\\" is a genuine phenomenon, and 5 with long rotation periods, contributing to the best assessment to date of dynamo driving in the \\\"unsaturated\\\" regime., Periodic radio bursts from very low mass stars and brown dwarfs simultaneously probe their magnetic and rotational properties. The brown dwarf 2MASSI J1047539+212423 (2M 1047+21) is currently the only T dwarf (T6.5) detected at radio wavelengths. Previous observations of this source with the Arecibo observatory revealed intermittent, 100%-polarized radio pulses similar to those detected from other brown dwarfs, but were unable to constrain a pulse periodicity; previous Very Large Array (VLA) observations detected quiescent emission a factor of \\u223c100 times fainter than the Arecibo pulses but no additional events. Here we present 14 hr of VLA observations of this object that reveal a series of pulses at \\u223c6 GHz with highly variable profiles, showing that the pulsing behavior evolves on time scales that are both long and short compared to the rotation period. We measure a periodicity of \\u223c1.77 hr and identify it with the rotation period. This is just the sixth rotation period measurement in a late T dwarf, and the first obtained in the radio. We detect a pulse at 10 GHz as well, suggesting that the magnetic field strength of 2 M 1047+21 reaches at least 3.6 kG. Although this object is the coolest and most rapidly rotating radio-detected brown dwarf to date, its properties appear continuous with those of other such objects, suggesting that the generation of strong magnetic fields and radio emission may continue to even cooler objects. Further studies of this kind will help to clarify the relationships between mass, age, rotation, and magnetic activity at and beyond the end of the main sequence, where both theories and observational data are currently scarce., We present analyses of new optical spectra of three WC9 stars, WR 88, WR 92 and WR 103 to test the suggestion that they exemplify an evolutionary sequence amongst the WC9 stars. The spectrum of WR 88 shows conspicuous lines of N III and N IV, leading to classification as a transitional WN8o/WC9 star. The three stars show a sequence of increasing O II and O III line strengths, confirming and extending earlier studies. The spectra were analysed using CMFGEN models, finding greater abundances of oxygen and carbon in WR 103 than in WR 92 and, especially, in WR 88. Of the three stars, only WR 103 makes circumstellar dust. We suggest that oxygen itself does not enhance this process but that it is its higher carbon abundance that allows WR 103 to make dust., , We present multi-epoch simultaneous radio, optical, H\\u03b1, UV, and X-ray observations of the active, young, low-mass binary NLTT 33370 AB (blended spectral type M7e). This system is remarkable for its extreme levels of magnetic activity: it is the most radio-luminous ultracool dwarf (UCD) known, and here we show that it is also one of the most X-ray luminous UCDs known. We detect the system in all bands and find a complex phenomenology of both flaring and periodic variability. Analysis of the optical light curve reveals the simultaneous presence of two periodicities, 3.7859 \\u00b1 0.0001 and 3.7130 \\u00b1 0.0002 hr. While these differ by only ~2%, studies of differential rotation in the UCD regime suggest that it cannot be responsible for the two signals. The system's radio emission consists of at least three components: rapid 100% polarized flares, bright emission modulating periodically in phase with the optical emission, and an additional periodic component that appears only in the 2013 observational campaign. We interpret the last of these as a gyrosynchrotron feature associated with large-scale magnetic fields and a cool, equatorial plasma torus. However, the persistent rapid flares at all rotational phases imply that small-scale magnetic loops are also present and reconnect nearly continuously. We present a spectral energy distribution of the blended system spanning more than 9 orders of magnitude in wavelength. The significant magnetism present in NLTT 33370 AB will affect its fundamental parameters, with the components' radii and temperatures potentially altered by ~+20% and ~-10%, respectively. Finally, we suggest spatially resolved observations that could clarify many aspects of this system's nature., Observations of the WC9+OB system WR65 in the infrared show variations of its dust emission consistent with a period near 4.8 yr, suggesting formation in a colliding-wind binary (CWB) having an elliptical orbit. If we adopt the IR maximum as zero phase, the times of X-ray maximum count and minimum extinction to the hard component measured by Oskinova &amp; Hamann fall at phases 0.4-0.5, when the separation of the WC9 and OB stars is greatest. We consider WR65 in the context of other WC8-9+OB stars showing dust emission., Visual photometry of 16 WC8-9 dust-making Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars during 2001-2009 was extracted from the All-Sky Automated Survey All Star Catalogue (ASAS-3) to search for eclipses attributable to extinction by dust formed in clumps in our line of sight. Data for a comparable number of dust-free WC6-9 stars were also examined to help characterize the data set. Frequent eclipses were observed from WR 104, and several from WR 106, extending the 1994-2001 studies by Kato et al., but not supporting their phasing the variations in WR 104 with its `pinwheel' rotation period. Only four other stars showed eclipses, WR 50 (one of the dust-free stars), WR 69, WR 95 and WR 117, and there may have been an eclipse by WR 121, which had shown two eclipses in the past. No dust eclipses were shown by the `historic' eclipsers WR 103 and WR 113. The atmospheric eclipses of the latter were observed but the suggestion by David-Uraz et al. that dust may be partly responsible for these is not supported. Despite its frequent eclipses, there is no evidence in the infrared images of WR 104 for dust made in its eclipses, demonstrating that any dust formed in this process is not a significant contributor to its circumstellar dust cloud and suggesting that the same applies to the other stars showing fewer eclipses., Although ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) are now known to generate and dissipate strong magnetic fields, a clear understanding of the underlying dynamo is still lacking. We have performed X-ray and radio observations of seven UCDs in a narrow range of spectral type (M6.5-M9.5) but spanning a wide range of projected rotational velocities (vsin i \\u2248 3-40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>). We have also analyzed unpublished archival Chandra observations of four additional objects. All of the newly observed targets are detected in the X-ray, while only one is detected in the radio, with the remainder having sensitive upper limits. We present a database of UCDs with both radio and X-ray measurements and consider the data in light of the so-called G\\u00fcdel-Benz relation (GBR) between magnetic activity in these bands. Some UCDs have very bright radio emission and faint X-ray emission compared to what would be expected for rapid rotators, while others show the opposite behavior. We show that UCDs would still be radio-overluminous relative to the GBR even if their X-ray emission were at standard rapid-rotator \\\"saturation\\\" levels. Recent results from Zeeman-Doppler imaging and geodynamo simulations suggest that rapidly rotating UCDs may harbor a bistable dynamo that supports either a stronger, axisymmetric magnetic field or a weaker, non-axisymmetric field. We suggest that the data can be explained in a scenario in which strong-field objects obey the GBR while weak-field objects are radio-overluminous and X-ray-underluminous, possibly because of a population of gyrosynchrotron-emitting coronal electrons that is continuously replenished by low-energy reconnection events., Sixty days of Doppler images from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) / Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) investigation during the 1996 and 2008 solar minima have been analyzed to show that certain supergranule characteristics (size, size range, and horizontal velocity) exhibit fluctuations of three to five days. Cross-correlating parameters showed a good, positive correlation between supergranulation size and size range, and a moderate, negative correlation between size range and velocity. The size and velocity do exhibit a moderate, negative correlation, but with a small time lag (less than 12 hours). Supergranule sizes during five days of co-temporal data from MDI and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) / Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) exhibit similar fluctuations with a high level of correlation between them. This verifies the solar origin of the fluctuations, which cannot be caused by instrumental artifacts according to these observations. Similar fluctuations are also observed in data simulations that model the evolution of the MDI Doppler pattern over a 60-day period. Correlations between the supergranule size and size range time-series derived from the simulated data are similar to those seen in MDI data. A simple toy-model using cumulative, uncorrelated exponential growth and decay patterns at random emergence times produces a time-series similar to the data simulations. The qualitative similarities between the simulated and the observed time-series suggest that the fluctuations arise from stochastic processes occurring within the solar convection zone. This behavior, propagating to surface manifestations of supergranulation, may assist our understanding of magnetic-field-line advection, evolution, and interaction., Radio observations established early on that some brown dwarfs host kilogauss magnetic fields, despite their low temperatures and the absence of the shearing tachocline that is believed to be key to the solar dynamo. The observed radio emission is often surprisingly bright, exceeding the standard magnetic radio/X-ray (G\\u00fcdel-Benz) relation by as much as five orders of magnitude. This effect is still not satisfactorily explained. In an attempt to improve matters, we have constructed and analyzed a comprehensive database of ultracool dwarfs with both radio and X-ray data, including new observations of seven targets with Chandra and the upgraded VLA. While all of the newly-observed objects were detected in the X-ray, only one was detected in the radio. These new targets are thus consistent with the standard relation, in striking contrast with some previous data. Some pairs of dwarfs with outwardly similar characteristics (spectral type, v sin i) have dramatically different emission properties, with radio/X-ray ratios that differ by two orders of magnitude. These results suggest that there is dramatic variance in ultracool magnetic activity. As we also discuss in a companion poster examining the relation between rotation and activity, variation in the topology of the magnetic field may explain the data. This work is supported in part by the NSF REU and DOD ASSURE programs under NSF grant no. 1262851 and by the Smithsonian Institution. We also acknowledge support from the NSF through Grant AST-1008361 and from NASA through Chandra Award Number G02-13007A issued by the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and NASA under contract NAS8-03060., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Co-temporal Doppler images from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)/Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) have been analyzed to extract quantitative information about global properties of the spatial and temporal characteristics of solar supergranulation. Preliminary comparisons show that supergranules appear to be smaller and have stronger horizontal velocity flows within HMI data than was measured with MDI. There appears to be no difference in their evolutionary timescales. Supergranule sizes and velocities were analyzed over a ten-day time period at a 15-minute cadence. While the averages of the time-series retain the aforementioned differences, fluctuations of these parameters first observed in MDI data were seen in both MDI and HMI time-series, exhibiting a strong cross-correlation. This verifies that these fluctuations are not instrumental, but are solar in origin. The observed discrepancies between the averaged values from the two sets of data are a consequence of instrument resolution. The lower spatial resolution of MDI results in larger observed structures with lower velocities than is seen in HMI. While these results offer a further constraint on the physical nature of supergranules, they also provide a level of calibration between the two instruments., Recent observations have led to a proposed new paradigm in which fast-rotating lowmass stars host magnetic dynamos that operate in distinct \\\"strong\\\" and \\\"weak\\\" modes; if true, there are large implications for exoplanets. Coronal X-ray data hint at this effect, but no detailed studies have been done. We propose an 80~ks investigation of four nearby cool dwarfs, two from each dynamo mode. All are bright X-ray emitters. The two dynamo modes are associated with different levels of variability, and XMM-Newton's large collecting area will allow a sensitive search for an X-ray manifestation of this. We will also compare abundances and emission measures using CCD and grating spectra. Our data will test this new paradigm and may provide an important new tool for investigating it., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4(+O?)+O8I: Wolf-Rayet system HD 36402 (= BAT99-38) in the Large Magellanic Cloud shows emission characteristic of heated dust. The dust emission is variable on a time-scale of years, with a period near 4.7 yr, possibly associated with orbital motion of the O8 supergiant and the inner P \\u2243 3.03-d WC4+O binary. The phase of maximum dust emission is close to that of the X-ray minimum, consistent with both processes being tied to colliding wind effects in an elliptical binary orbit. It is evident that Wolf-Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Radio detections of ultracool dwarfs provide insight into their magnetic fields and the dynamos that maintain them, especially at the very bottom of the main sequence, where other activity indicators dramatically weaken. Until recently, radio emission was only detected in the M and L dwarf regimes, but this has changed with the Arecibo detection of rapid polarized flares from the T6.5 dwarf 2MASS J10475385+2124234. Here, we report the detection of quasi-quiescent radio emission from this source at 5.8 GHz using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The spectral luminosity is L <SUB>\\u03bd</SUB> = (2.2 \\u00b1 0.7) \\u00d7 10<SUP>12</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>, a factor of ~100 times fainter than the Arecibo flares. Our detection is the lowest luminosity yet achieved for an ultracool dwarf. Although the emission is fully consistent with being steady, unpolarized, and broad band, we find tantalizing hints for variability. We exclude the presence of short-duration flares as seen by Arecibo, although this is not unexpected given estimates of the duty cycle. Follow-up observations of this object will offer the potential to constrain its rotation period, electron density, and the strength and configuration of the magnetic field. Equally important, follow-up observations will address the question of whether the electron cyclotron maser instability, which is thought to produce the flares seen by Arecibo, also operates in the very different parameter regime of the emission we detect, or whether instead this ultracool dwarf exhibits both maser and gyrosynchrotron radiation, potentially originating from substantially different locations., Until recently, it was generally assumed that brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars would not be able to generate and sustain large-scale magnetic fields. Over the past several years, however, observations have shown that some of these ``ultracool dwarfs'' do precisely that. The available evidence does indicate that a substantial evolution in magnetic activity occurs at spectral types M7 and later -- plausibly the onset of the evolution from stellar-type toward planetary-type magnetospheric physics. We discuss the stellar rotation/X-ray activity relationship and its ultracool analogue, which remains poorly-characterized. I show how collected observations are providing strong hints of rotational supersaturation of UCD X-ray activity, which will strongly inform the theoretical understanding of magnetospheres beyond the bottom of the main sequence., The solar rotation profile both at the photosphere and within the solar convective zone (SCZ) and tachocline is now well-known. Physically, it determines and is determined by both the meridional circulation and the internal stress tensor in the SCZ. One of the contributions to the stress in the SCZ is the turbulent, tangled magnetic field due to magnetoconvection. In previous work we have discussed a viscoelastic model for the stress tensor. This viscoelastic model attempts to recover the stress due to the sub-integral scale magnetic field. We have argued that the inclusion of such a model in simulations could have a significant effect on the predicted meridional circulation of the SCZ, and therefore also the predicted angular momentum balance and solar rotation profile. Here we present for the first time the numerical results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the SCZ including our viscoelastic model for the turbulent Maxwell stress. Depending on choice of parameters, these stresses can contribute to a forcing of the meridional circulation that is clockwise (CW) in the usual notation, which tends to distribute angular momentum more in keeping with observations. We argue that including viscoelastic terms in the prescription for the stress tensor may offer an improved method of predicting the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation in the SCZ when performing 2D simulations., Searches for slow radio transients and variables have generally focused on extragalactic populations, and the basic parameters of Galactic populations remain poorly characterized. We present a large 3 GHz survey performed with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) that aims to improve this situation: ASGARD, the ATA Survey of Galactic Radio Dynamism. ASGARD observations spanned two years with weekly visits to 23 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in two fields in the Galactic plane, totaling 900 hr of integration time on science fields and making it significantly larger than previous efforts. The typical blind unresolved source detection limit was 10 mJy. We describe the observations and data analysis techniques in detail, demonstrating our ability to create accurate wide-field images while effectively modeling and subtracting large-scale radio emission, allowing standard transient-and-variability analysis techniques to be used. We present early results from the analysis of two pointings: one centered on the microquasar Cygnus X-3 and one overlapping the Kepler field of view (l = 76\\u00b0, b = +13.\\u00b05). Our results include images, catalog statistics, completeness functions, variability measurements, and a transient search. Out of 134 sources detected in these pointings, the only compellingly variable one is Cygnus X-3, and no transients are detected. We estimate number counts for potential Galactic radio transients and compare our current limits to previous work and our projection for the fully analyzed ASGARD data set., State-of-the-art radio interferometers are complex systems that unleash torrents of data. If current and planned instruments are to routinely meet their performance goals, standard analysis techniques must be significantly improved, becoming simultaneously more sophisticated, more automatic, and more scalable. While there is no shortage of ideas for next-generation algorithms, there is a shortage of development resources, so it is vital that programming environments for interferometric software allow for rapid, flexible development. We present an open-source software package, miriad-python, that provides access to the MIRIAD interferometric reduction system in the Python programming language. The modular design of MIRIAD and the high productivity and accessibility of Python provide an excellent foundation for rapid development of interferometric software. Several other projects with similar goals exist, and we describe them and compare miriad-python with them in detail. Along with an overview of the package design, we present sample code and applications, including the detection of millisecond astrophysical transients, determination and application of nonstandard calibration parameters, interactive data visualization, and a reduction pipeline using a directed acyclic graph dependency model analogous to that of the traditional UNIX tool make. The key aspects of the miriad-python software project are documented. We find that miriad-python provides an extremely effective environment for prototyping new interferometric software, though certain existing packages provide far more infrastructure for some applications. While equivalent software written in compiled languages can be much faster than Python, there are many situations in which execution time is profitably exchanged for speed of development, code readability, accessibility to nonexpert programmers, quick interlinking with foreign software packages, and other virtues of the Python language., In previous work we argued that jets might not be produced through magnetocentrifugal acceleration, but rather through the toroidal stresses of magnetorotational instability (MRI)-driven turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion in a geometrically thick disk or flow. High accretion-rate protostars are among the best candidates for this process because a geometrically thick accretion disk that extends down to the central star is more plausible in this context than in other protostellar systems. These systems are also cleaner objects to study than active galactic nuclei (AGN), microquasars, and the like, which necessarily involve more exotic relativistic physics. <P />Here we present a novel in-depth analysis of the laboratory analog that inspired our work on this topic. This analog consists of the meridional flow around a rotating sphere in a viscoelastic fluid. We examine in detail the fluxes of mass, angular momentum, linear momentum, and energy, and how these depend upon system parameters. We find that the presence of an axial outflow depends critically upon the ratio of the analogous turbulent magnetic stress to turbulent Reynolds stress, which must be roughly equal to or larger than unity to drive an outflow. We also find that the flux of angular momentum can actually be opposed to the flow of matter within the outflow, despite the fact that the outflow is ultimately powered by the radial transport of angular momentum from the central object. In particular we show that, in contrast with magnetocentrifugal acceleration, the angular momentum of the outflow actually decreases even while the material is being axially accelerated. This translates to observational tests in protostellar jets. <P />There are some obvious enormous differences between compressible flow in a gravitational field and incompressible flow in a laboratory. We address this and we and argue why, despite these differences, there is much to learn from this laboratory system., This memo describes the system used to conduct commensal correlator and beamformer observations at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). This system was deployed for ~2 years until the ATA hibernation in 2011 and was responsible for collecting &gt;5 TB of data during thousands of hours of observations. The general system design is presented and the implementation is discussed in detail. I emphasize the rationale for various design decisions and attempt to document a few aspects of ATA operations that might not be obvious to non-insiders. I close with some recommendations from my experience developing the software infrastructure and managing the correlator observations. These include: reuse existing systems; solve, don't avoid, tensions between projects, and share infrastructure; plan to make standalone observations to complement the commensal ones; and be considerate of observatory staff when deploying new and unusual observing modes. The structure of the software codebase is documented., Systematic studies of transient and variable radio emission are a relative novelty. Searches for \\\"slow\\u201d radio transients, sources that vary over timescales of days to months, have so far tended to focus on extragalactic fields. Many Galactic sources, however, vary on these timescales, including X-ray binaries, brown dwarfs, and several objects of unknown nature discovered in previous efforts. We present AGILITE, the ATA Galactic Lightcurve and Transient Experiment, an effort to characterize the population of Galactic radio transients and variables more fully. AGILITE has a large overall footprint (\\u224825 deg), a substantial number of epochs (\\u2248200), and a significant dedication of observatory time (? hr over two years), which make it sensitive to rare objects as well as variability on many timescales. We describe the AGILITE pipeline and the current status of the project. We discuss prospects for the complete survey as well as other applications of the dataset, such as large-scale mapping of extended radio emission in the Galactic Plane., The revolution in digital technology that has had so many obvious effects in recent decades has not spared the field of astronomy. It has led to an enormous improvement in astronomers' ability to study the \\\"time domain,\\\" the expected and unexpected ways in which celestial objects change on timescales ranging from milliseconds to centuries. In the field of radio astronomy a variety of advances have led to a new breed of observatories that are orders of magnitude more efficient at surveying the sky than previous facilities. These new observatories produce data at prodigous rates, however, and require sophisticated analysis to take full advantage of their capabilities. With several major facilities coming online in the next few years, there is an urgent need to prove that terabytes of data can be reliably turned into genuine astrophysical results. This dissertation develops tools and techniques for coping with this challenge and applies them to data obtained with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA), a pioneering next-generation radio observatory located in Northern California. The ATA was built from the ground up to be a fast survey instrument, incorporating a suite of the new technologies that figure prominently in the new telescopes. I develop and describe miriad-python, a framework for the rapid development of interferometric analysis software that is used in a variety of ways in my subsequent research. I also present a robust software system for executing multiple observing campaigns cooperatively (\\\"commensally\\\") at the ATA. Data from the ATA are difficult to analyze due to nontraditional features such as a large instantaneous field of view; continuous coverage of a large, interference-prone frequency range; and broadband, movable feeds; I describe and implement several methods for coping with these challenges. This technical work is driven by the needs of a variety of astrophysical applications. I use broadband spectra of starforming galaxies to investigate the \\\"calorimeter\\\" interpretation of their cosmic ray energetics. The data are consistent with a recent hypothesis that the magnetic fields in these galaxies are stronger than traditionally thought. I use the survey capabilities of the ATA to conduct ASGARD, a large survey of the Galactic component of the dynamic radio sky, which has remained poorly-explored due to the limitations of previous obseratories and the technical challenges involved. I discuss in detail the methods used to analyze the data and provide catalogs, maps, completeness functions, and variability statistics. I map extended radio structures in Galactic fields and show how they can be subtracted from the data to simplify the search for transient Galactic sources. I limit the density of transient sources brighter than 10 mJy to be &lt;0.5 deg-2 at 95% confidence. One of the areas of emphasis in this survey was the fascinating system Cygnus X-3, which shows prominent flares across the electromagnetic spectrum. Observations from 2010 May show a bright (1 Jy) radio flare followed by a 4.3sigma gamma-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) \\u223c 1.5 days later. This timing is inconsistent with standard inverse-Compton models, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be responsible for the system's high-energy emission., Supergranulation is a well-observed solar phenomenon despite its underlying mechanisms remaining a mystery. Originally considered to arise due to convective motions, alternative mechanisms have been suggested such as the cumulative downdrafts of granules as well as displaying wave-like properties. Supergranule characteristics are well documented, however. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for more than half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) continues to produce Doppler images enabling the continuation of supergranulation studies made with SOHO/MDI, but with superior temporal and spatial resolution. The size-distribution of divergent cellular flows observed on the photosphere now reaches down to granular scales, allowing contemporaneous comparisons between the two flow components. SOHO/MDI Doppler observations made during the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 exhibit fluctuations of supergranule characteristics (global averages of the supergranule size, size-range and horizontal velocity) with periods of 3-5 days. Similar fluctuations have been observed in SDO/HMI Dopplergrams and the high correlation between co-temporal HMI &amp; MDI suggest a solar origin. Their nature has been probed by invoking data simulations that produce realistic Dopplergrams based on MDI data., In 2009, Cygnus X-3 (Cyg X-3) became the first microquasar to be detected in the GeV \\u03b3-ray regime, via the satellites Fermi and AGILE. The addition of this new band to the observational toolbox holds promise for building a more detailed understanding of the relativistic jets of this and other systems. We present a rich data set of radio, hard and soft X-ray, and \\u03b3-ray observations of Cyg X-3 made during a flaring episode in 2010 May. We detect a ~3 day softening and recovery of the X-ray emission, followed almost immediately by a ~1 Jy radio flare at 15 GHz, followed by a 4.3\\u03c3 \\u03b3-ray flare (E &gt; 100 MeV) ~1.5 days later. The radio sampling is sparse, but we use archival data to argue that it is unlikely the \\u03b3-ray flare was followed by any significant unobserved radio flares. In this case, the sequencing of the observed events is difficult to explain in a model in which the \\u03b3-ray emission is due to inverse Compton scattering of the companion star's radiation field. Our observations suggest that other mechanisms may also be responsible for \\u03b3-ray emission from Cyg X-3., Supergranulation exhibits both radial and horizontal velocity components within Doppler data. The weak, radial flows drag magnetic field lines to the surface while their strong, divergent, horizontal counterparts advect the field to the edges of the supergranulation cells. Field congregation at supergranule boundaries is observed in magnetic filed images and via Ca II K observations of the chromospheric network. <P />Supergranulation characteristics, such as typical sizes and velocities, have been studied using MDI Doppler data and tracked over 60-days of observations made in 1996 and 2008, relating to periods of solar minimum. Time-series of these characteristics exhibit regular fluctuations on the order of 3-5 days. These time-series are analyzed to extract frequency information and cross-correlated to investigate any temporal link between the characteristics. <P />Whether the fluctuations are an instrumental artifact is studied by comparing contemporaneous time series produced from SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI Dopplergrams. There exists a high correlation between the two time-series showing that the fluctuations are solar in origin., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that manifests itself on the photosphere as a cellular network of around 35 Mm across, with a turnover lifetime of 1 - 2 days. It is strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field. The horizontal, divergent flows within supergranule cells carry local field lines to the cell boundaries, while the rotational properties of supergranule upflows may contribute to the restoration of the poloidal field as part of the dynamo mechanism, which controls the solar cycle. The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended length. It is of interest to study whether the convective phenomena that influence the solar magnetic field during this time differed in character from periods of previous minima. This study investigates three characteristics (velocity components, sizes and lifetimes) of solar supergranulation. Comparisons of these characteristics are made between the minima of cycles 22/23 and 23/24 using MDI Doppler data from 1996 and 2008, respectively. It is found that whereas the lifetimes are equal during both epochs (around 18 h), the sizes are larger in 1996 (35.9 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm) than in 2008 (35.0 \\u00b1 0.3 Mm), while the dominant horizontal velocity flows are weaker (139 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 1996; 141 \\u00b1 1 m s<SUP>\\u22121</SUP> in 2008). Although numerical differences are seen, they are not conclusive proof of the most recent minimum being inherently unusual., The microquasar Cygnus X-3 is one of the few Galactic sources known to produce relativistic jets and can be one of the brightest radio sources in the Galaxy when flaring. In late 2009 it became the first such system to be seen in the gamma-ray regime with detections by both AGILE and Fermi. We have observed Cyg X-3 at 3 GHz every 5 days for the past six months with the Allen Telescope Array in conjunction with space-based X-ray (INTEGRAL, RXTE) and gamma-ray (Fermi) observations. We present results from both the long-term dataset and intensive observing sessions in which we obtain the radio lightcurve of Cyg X-3 on 10-minute timescales. We focus particularly on a May 2010 minor flare event for which we have coverage in all three bands.The first phase of the ATA was funded through generous grants from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. UC Berkeley, the SETI Institute, the National Science Foundation (Grant No. 0540599), Sun Microsystems, Xilinx, Nathan Myhrvold, Greg Papadopoulos, and other corporations and individual donors contributed additional funding., Following the announcement of a 98 GHz flare from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (ATel #3130), we observed it with the <A href=\\\"http://ral.berkeley.edu/ata/\\\">Allen Telescope Array</A> (Welch et al., <A href=\\\"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009IEEEP..97.1438W\\\">2009 Proc. IEEE 97 1438</A> for 2.5 hours beginning at 2011 January 28.848 UT (MJD 55589.848), about 4.0 hours after the 98 GHz observations concluded., The solar minimum at the transition from cycle 23 to 24 was notable for its low level of activity and its extended duration. Among the various fields of study, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. This study continues previous investigations of the characteristics of solar supergranulation, a convection component strongly linked to the structure of the magnetic field, namely the time-evolution of the global mean of supergranule cell size, determined from spectral analysis of MDI Dopplergrams from the two previous solar minima. Analyses of the global mean of supergranule sizes show a quasi-oscillatory nature to the evolution of this particular supergranule characteristic. Performing similar analyses on realistic, synthetic Doppler images show similar time-dependent characteristics. We conclude that the observed fluctuations are not observational artifacts, and that an underlying trend exists within the evolution of the supergranulation network., Infrared photometry of the probable triple WC4 (+O?) +O8I: system HD 36402 (BAT99-38) in the LMC shows emission characteristic of heated dust. Although HD 36402 is close to two luminous YSOs, it is possible to distinguish its emission at wavelengths less than 10 microns. Simple modelling indicates a dust temperature near 800 K and mass of about 1.5 \\u00d7 10^{-7} M_\\u2299 amorphous carbon grains. The dust emission appears to be variable. It is apparent that Wolf Rayet dust formation occurs also in metal-poor environments., Supergranulation is a component of solar convection that assists in the outward transportation of internal energy. Supergranule cells are approximately 35 Mm across, have lifetimes on the order of a day and have divergent horizontal velocities of around 300 m/s, a factor of 10 higher than their central radial components. While they have been observed using Doppler methods for around half a century, their existence is also observed in other datasets such as magnetograms and Ca II K images. These datasets clearly show the influence of supergranulation on solar magnetism and how the local field is organized by the flows of supergranule cells. The Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard SDO is making fresh observations of convection phenomena at a higher cadence and a higher resolution that should make granular features visible. Granulation and supergranulation characteristics can now be compared within the same datasets, which may lead to further understanding of any mutual influences. The temporal and spatial enhancements of HMI will also reduce the noise level within studies of convection so that more detailed studies of their characteristics may be made. We present analyses of SDO/HMI Dopplergrams that provide new estimates of convection cell sizes, lifetimes, and velocity flows, as well as the rotation rates of the convection patterns across the solar disk. We make comparisons with previous data produced by MDI, as well as from data simulations., Solar supergranulation plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. It is clearly detected within SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams, from which a variety of properties may be derived. Techniques that extract spatial, temporal, and kinematic characteristics and provide comparisons for the two most recent solar minima are described. Although supergranule lifetimes are comparable between these minima, their sizes may be slightly smaller during the recent minimum., Visual observations of NSV 19431 and YY Cen spanning the twentyeight years 1980 through 2007 are discussed. These show NSV 19431 is a Mira star of mean period of 298.1 days and visual brightness range of 10.8 to fainter than 15.0. Elements for determining the dates of maximum brightness are JD 2447700 \\u00b1 298.1 days (\\u00b110 days). The O-C diagram shows what appear to be random cycleto-cycle fluctuations with a current mean cycle of 298.1 days, evident from the maximum of JD 2447700 (1989). <P />YY Cen is a Mira star of mean period 371.3 days and brightness range 10.6 to fainter than 15.0. On at least three occasions during this twenty-eight years YY Cen has experienced individual cycles that are significantly longer or shorter than the 371.3-day mean period. Subsequent cycles remain close to the mean period but there is a resulting clear shift in the O-C values. Elements for predicting the dates of maximum brightness are JD2446897 \\u00b1 371.3 days (\\u00b110 days), but they should be treated with some caution due to the random instances of long/short cycles observed thus far and which may prove to be a long term characteristic of YY Cen., With its elongated tail and extended periods of zero activity, the period marking the transition from solar cycle 23 to 24 has seemed peculiar when compared to other minima. Among the various phenomena studied, the evolution of the solar convection zone may provide insight into the causes and consequences of this recent minimum. <P />Convection in the Sun plays an important role in generating and structuring the solar magnetic field and as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. The observed phenomena are strongly linked within both observational and physical regimes. <P />This study uses SOHO/MDI Dopplergrams to highlight supergranulation within the line-of-sight velocity data. Suites of analysis methods are applied to time-series of Doppler images to quantitatively describe supergranule flow velocities, spatial scales and temporal lifetimes. <P />The results show similarities in supergranule evolution (1/e lifetimes of 18 hours), while their sizes are smaller and their flows stronger during the 23-24 minimum compared to 22-23. We also present provisional results of statistical analyses performed both within and between the various data sets, some of which tend to show a quasi-oscillatory nature. <P />Future studies to place this work in the wider context of the solar cycle are discussed, as a whole as well as investigations of supergranule characteristics found in various other data such as magnetograms and CaIIK images. Observed hemispheric asymmetries will be presented and how our methods may be applied to further these enquiries., The potential role of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the protostellar jet phenomenon is uncertain but intriguing. A number of works in theory and simulation have explored whether and how the MRI may be important to the processes of jet formation, powering, launching, and collimation. Not all of this work is directly related to protostellar jets, but much of it is. <P />Here, I do not discuss experiments that attempt to reproduce the magnetorotational instability in the laboratory. Rather, I discuss laboratory experiments on meridional flows in viscoelastic fluids and their relationship to MRI-driven jet flows, as I have previously. I argue that these laboratory experiments have much more to tell us about the nature of jets, and jets in protostars in particular. <P />To this end, I discuss briefly how these laboratory analogs of protostellar jets may posses a critical surface analogous to the transonic point in astrophysical jets. I show how the momentum flux and kinetic energy flux in the laboratory experiments may relate to these corresponding fluxes in protostellar jets, and I show how these fluxes depend upon the rotation speed of the central object. I discuss the differing roles of angular momentum transport in the laboratory and in astrophysical jets, and the salient differences between these two systems. <P />Finally, I argue that abandonment of a few common theoretical assumptions regarding the flow conditions in the jet launching region can lead to the hypothesis that a turbulent, thick accretion flow in protostars can produce jets without any magnetorotational acceleration whatsoever. Most importantly, the accretion flow must be hot and geometrically thick. To the extent that this is analogous to a very thick boundary layer, this contradicts the standard argument that accretion boundary layers must be relatively thin when they exist., , Although the relationship between the far-infrared and centimeter-wave radio luminosities of normal galaxies is one of the most striking correlations in astronomy, a solid understanding of its physical basis is lacking. In one interpretation, the \\\"calorimeter model,\\\" rapid synchrotron cooling of cosmic ray electrons is essential in reproducing the observed linear relationship. Observed radio spectra, however, are shallower than what is expected of cooled synchrotron emission. In 2006, Thompson et al. presented a simple parameterized model to explain how relatively shallow observed spectra might arise even in the presence of rapid synchrotron cooling by accounting for ionization losses and other cooling mechanisms. During the commissioning of the 42 element Allen Telescope Array (ATA), we observed the starburst galaxies M82, NGC 253, and Arp 220 at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7 GHz, obtaining unprecedented broadband continuous radio spectra of these sources. We combine our observations with high-frequency data from the literature to separate the spectra into thermal and nonthermal components. The nonthermal components all steepen in the centimeter-wave regime and cannot be well modeled as simple power laws. The model of Thompson et al. is consistent with our M82 results when plausible parameters are chosen, and our results in fact significantly shrink the space of allowed model parameters. The model is only marginally consistent with our NGC 253 data. Assuming the Thompson et al. model, a steep electron energy injection index of p = -2.5 is ruled out in M82 and NGC 253 to &gt;99% confidence. We describe in detail the observing procedures, calibration methods, analysis, and consistency checks used for broadband spectral observations with the ATA., The galactic center (GC) teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. While slow radio transients have been detected toward the GC both serendipitously and systematically, the characterization of these sources has typically suffered from poor spectral and temporal coverage. The ongoing ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) improves on previous work in both of these domains. In the frequency domain, the AGCTS surveys the GC at 1.43 and 2.01 GHz simultaneously using two correlators of the 42-element Allen Telescope Array (ATA-42). In the temporal domain, AGCTS observations are conducted about four nights a week and have been running for more than six months. During a typical night, 25 square degrees near the galactic plane are observed for a total of 3 hours. The AGCTS dataset will thus have excellent temporal sampling of a large area with spectral index information. We present some early results and discuss our analysis techniques. While the correlator observations proceed, three beamformers are used to conduct a SETI search in the field of view. These commensal observations are discussed in another poster in this session (\\\"The ATA Galactic Center Survey: SETI Observations in 2009\\u201d by P. Backus)., The galactic center teems with transient phenomena at all wavelengths. The ATA Galactic Center Transient Survey (AGCTS) started in May 2009 and is currently observing 20 square degrees of sky for 6 hours every night commensally with SETI observations. The AGCTS will collect 6 months of data operating simultaneously at two frequencies, generating a powerful dataset with spectral index information and uniform temporal coverage and observational parameters. We expect to attain a sensitivity of 1 mJy/bm per hour-long integration and either detect significant numbers of transient events or establish robust upper limits on event rates. We present our observing and analysis techniques as well as preliminary results., Aims: We present a new method for the treatment of the advection of solar supergranulation by giant cells, a large-scale analogue to the observed property of granule advection by supergranules. <BR />Methods: The proposed method is derived from a description of solar convection via spherical harmonics and spectral coefficients, allowing the investigation of the influence of a giant cell component on a realistic supergranule signal. <BR />Results: We show that a supergranule pattern derived from real data, as well as a simplified test signal, can be advected by a giant cell component of various sizes. <BR />Conclusions: The identified behaviour is in analogy to observed supergranulation patterns, including those based on MDI Dopplergrams, which show wavelike supergranulation patterns, even after the removal of the geometric projection effect. Our method is an important step towards the construction of future models involving supergranule flow patterns advected by a giant cell flow. Nevertheless, additional efforts are required to obtain a final verification of giant cells as a separate component of the solar photospheric convection spectrum. <P />New address: <P />NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA., , We present infrared photometry of the episodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet system WR19 (LS3), tracking its fading from a third observed dust formation episode in 2007 and strengthening the view that these episodes are periodic (P = 10.1 +/- 0.1y). Radial velocities (RVs) of the O9 component observed between 2001 and 2008 show RV variations consistent with WR19 being a spectroscopic binary of high eccentricity (e = 0.8), having periastron passage in 2007.14, shortly before the phase of dust formation. In this respect, WR19 resembles the archetypical episodic dust-making colliding wind binary system WR140. <P />Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile, in allocations 67.D-0043, 70.D-0266, 72.D-0070, 73.D-0027, 74.D-0116, 76.D-0029, 78.D-0001, 79.D-0092 and 80.D-0198. <P />E-mail: pmw@roe.ac.uk, Convection in the Sun plays an important role as a mechanism responsible for the 11-year solar cycle. Magnetic field phenomena are thus inextricably linked to the convective process, an example being the gathering of magnetic field lines around supergranule boundaries observed as the chromospheric network. <P />Our research asks to what extent variations in the global magnetic field affect particular characteristics of photospheric convection features, using Dopplergrams derived from SOHO/MDI data during the course of Solar Cycle 23. <P />We look ahead to the higher resolution data that SDO/HMI will provide and any further insight such data may provide., We present high-resolution infrared (2-18 \\u03bcm) images of the archetypal periodic dust-making Wolf-Rayet binary system WR140 (HD 193793) taken between 2001 and 2005, and multi-colour (J - [19.5]) photometry observed between 1989 and 2001. The images resolve the dust cloud formed by WR140 in 2001, allowing us to track its expansion and cooling, while the photometry allows tracking the average temperature and total mass of the dust. The combination of the two data sets constrains the optical properties of the dust, and suggests that they differ from those of the dust made by the WC9 dust-makers, including the classical `pinwheel', WR104. The photometry of individual dust emission features shows them to be significantly redder in (nbL'-[3.99]), but bluer in ([7.9]-[12.5]), than the binary, as expected from the spectra of heated dust and the stellar wind of a Wolf-Rayet star. The most persistent dust features, two concentrations at the ends of a `bar' of emission to the south of the star, were observed to move with constant proper motions of 324 +/- 8 and 243 +/- 7 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Longer wavelength (4.68 and 12.5 \\u03bcm) images show dust emission from the corresponding features from the previous (1993) periastron passage and dust formation episode, showing that the dust expanded freely in a low-density void for over a decade, with dust features repeating from one cycle to the next. A third persistent dust concentration to the east of the binary (the `arm') was found to have a proper motion ~320 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a dust mass about one-quarter that of the `bar'. Extrapolation of the motions of the concentrations back to the binary suggests that the eastern `arm' began expansion four to five months earlier than those in the southern `bar', consistent with the projected rotation of the binary axis and wind-collision region (WCR) on the sky. A comparison of model dust images and the observations constrains the intervals when the WCR was producing sufficiently compressed wind for dust nucleation in the WCR, and suggests that the distribution of this material was not uniform about the axis of the WCR, but more abundant in the following edge in the orbital plane., While the correlation between the far infrared (FIR) and radio emission of starforming (SF) galaxies is well-supported observationally, a detailed understanding of this relationship remains elusive. The \\\"calorimeter\\\" model of the FIR-radio correlation requires that relativistic electrons in SF galaxies cool completely before they exit the galactic disk. Thompson et al. (2006) show that breaks in the radio spectra of SF galaxies at GHz frequencies can be used to diagnose whether this condition, in fact, holds. <P />We present Allen Telescope Array (ATA) observations of the starburst galaxies NGC 253 and M82 and the extreme starburst galaxy Arp 220. The continuous frequency capability of the ATA enables the construction of spectra with dense sampling at frequencies between 0.5 and 7 GHz. Repeated measurements indicate a typical precision in flux density of better than 10% in an individual scan. Our data allow measurement of variations in the spectral index across the range of frequencies observed. <P />The techniques for obtaining continuous spectra demonstrated herein also have valuable applications to the study of many other targets, including compact symmetric objects, gigahertz-peaked sources, and intra-day variables. The lessons learned from their implementation on the ATA have ramifications for future centimeter-wavelength observatories with continuous frequency coverage such as the Extended Very Large Array and the Square Kilometer Array. <P />This work was supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship., While both society and astronomy have evolved greatly over the past fifty years, the academic institutions and incentives that shape our field have remained largely stagnant. As a result, the astronomical community is faced with several major challenges, including: (1) the training that we provide does not align with the skills that future astronomers will need, (2) the postdoctoral phase is becoming increasingly demanding and demoralizing, and (3) our jobs are increasingly unfriendly to families with children. Solving these problems will require conscious engineering of our profession. Fortunately, this Decadal Review offers the opportunity to revise outmoded practices to be more effective and equitable. The highest priority of the Subcommittee on the State of the Profession should be to recommend specific, funded activities that will ensure the field meets the challenges we describe., The recent high-resolution infrared images of the enigmatic cocoon stars in the Quintuplet cluster showing them to have ``pinwheel'' tails, and the deduction that they are colliding-wind Wolf-Rayet binaries, shows how far the study of colliding-wind dust formation has come since the first discovery of heated carbon dust around the classical WC9 star Ve2-45 (WR 104) in the early days of infrared astronomy. The formation of dust is the least expected, and hardest to understand, process attributed to colliding stellar winds, and direct evidence of the connection is only now becoming available. I will review recent work and consider systems showing a range of dust-formation phenomena, including the prototypical epsiodic dust-maker WR 140 and the variable dust-maker WR 70, also long studied by Virpi Niemela and her colleagues., Continuous frequency coverage is an important scientific and technical goal of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We investigate one avenue of reaching this goal with data taken from the high-resolution, broadband correlator of the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). With a total frequency coverage of 0.5 to 11.2 GHz and 1024 channels in a spectral window 100 MHz wide, the ATA is an ideal exploratory instrument for this kind of science. We present observations of calibrators taken over a broad swath of the ATA's frequency range and show how the well-known spectral indices of these sources can be recovered. With this consistency check in hand, a few sample broadband spectra and images of more scientifically interesting targets are presented. Our experiments explore the continuous frequency performance of the ATA antennas, feeds, and receivers and also identify the limitations that radio frequency interference place on our ability to make images. Further observations of this kind at the ATA will yield not only intriguing standalone science results but also valuable knowledge about the developments needed to endow the SKA with a robust continuous frequency capability., In recent years, solar observations have moved from ground-based telescopes to observatories on Earth orbiting satellites, such as SOHO. They provide us with a clear and uninterrupted view of the solar disk. One instrument upon SOHO, the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI), has proved fruitful in providing not only important information of the solar photosphere but, in combination with helioseismic methods, a method for probing the solar interior. <P />This dissertation discusses current investigations by myself and my collaborators into surface manifestations of convection phenomena, using Doppler velocity data from MDI and produced from computer simulations. The Doppler data reveal convection cells much larger than the granulation seen easily by optical telescopes. These supergranules' originate deeper within the convection layer than the granules and, like their smaller counterparts, are heavily influential in structuring the magnetic field and subsequently play an important role in controlling aspects of the solar activity cycle. <P />My work presented in this dissertation shows that the supergranulation pattern seems to rotate faster than the surface plasma. It has been suggested that the pattern is driven by wave-like phenomena, but instead we find the reason is a geometric effect with respect to the observer. We further find that supergranules are also responsible for observed corrugation features on the solar surface, which previously had been interpreted as Rossby wave hills. <P />We extend our convection spectrum and Doppler map production simulations to include axisymmetric flows such as differential rotation, which contribute to the evolution of the velocity field. These models assist in understanding how such large-scale surface flows influence the surface motions of supergranules. <P />Lastly, I describe the construction of a numerical experiment to study the influence of a 'giant-cell' velocity field on the supergranule pattern. Such non-axisymmetric flows would further contribute to supergranule advection and the results of such experiments may assist in the observation of these hitherto elusive 'giant-cells'., Geometrically thin accretion disks are azimuthally supersonic, but vertically subsonic. Outflow in well-collimated jets is typically axially supersonic, but radially and azimuthally subsonic in the jet core. Particularly in a thick inner disk or flow, the transition from supersonic azimuthal motion to supersonic axial motion can be made in a flow in which the gas that is ejected is nowhere subsonic. Here, we investigate this possibility within protostellar jet systems. Such a scenario bears some semblance to scramjets, i.e. supersonic combustion ramjets, in which gas flow is nowhere subsonic. Of course, in the case of protostellar jets, the energy source is not combustion but release of gravitational potential energy from accreting gas and/or transfer of mechanical energy from a rotating central object. Nevertheless, there are some dynamical and thermodynamic similarities between scramjets and our protostellar jet outflow scenario, which we explore., We explore the nature of ``hills'' observed on the solar surface that had previously been attributed to Rossby waves. We investigate the solar hills phenomenon by analyzing the output from a synthetic model based solely on the observed solar photospheric convection spectrum. We show that the characteristics of these hills can be explained by the corrugation of the surface produced by the radial flows of the convection. The hills in our simulations are dominated by supergranules, a well-known component of solar convection. Rossby waves have been predicted to exist within the Sun and may play an important role in the dynamics of the solar interior, including the Sun's differential rotation and magnetic dynamo. Our study suggests, however, that the hills observed at the solar limb do not confirm the existence of solar Rossby waves., Visual observations of the neglected Mira variable V407 Sco during the ten-year interval 1997 through 2006 provide a revised period and epoch for maximum brightness. The dates of maximum are represented by the elements JD 2453612 \\u00b1 401.5 (\\u00b1 4 days) \\u00b7 E. The brightness range is from magnitude 10.2 to fainter than 14.5., Observations of the 1.083-\\u03bcm He i line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile, consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (\\u03b8) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10-\\u03bcm) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a `splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., Visual observations of DI Car between 2001 June and 2005 August are plotted according to phase relative to the previously published elements HJD 2438553.70 + 29.210 days. They support the suggestion that DI Car is a regular pulsating star and confirms the variable depth of minimum brightness., Observers have misidentified the semiregular variable T CMa over many years due to the use of charts with insufficient detail. A detailed chart is provided to allow for correct identification and it is also suggested T CMa may be non-variable and should be dropped from observing lists., Previous work on the angular momentum balance and meridional circulation of the solar convective zone (SCZ) generally consists either of semi-analytic approaches in which a simple turbulence model is adopted, or full direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the hydrodynamics or magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In both <P />instances the inclusion of magnetic fields has been troublesome. Also, <P />both approaches have had difficulty reproducing the known angular velocity profile of the SCZ; this is the Taylor Number Puzzle. <P />I discuss preliminary work in which I incorporate magnetic fields into a viscoelastic turbulence model for the SCZ and apply this to the problem of meridional circulation and angular momentum balance. The principle idea is that turbulent magnetic fields act like long polymers and give the plasma elastic properties. I suggest that such an approach may help solve the Taylor Number Puzzle of the SCZ and bring theoretical predictions for the large-scale motion of the SCZ in line with observations., Visual observations of the little studied Mira variable star SW Hor during the 18-year interval 1986 through 2003 are presented. These provide the basic parameters of its variability, information that had previously been lacking from the catalogue data. An extreme visual magnitude range of 9.9 to fainter than 15 is found and a mean period of 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 days determined. Elements for maximum brightness are JD 2447124 + 283 \\u00c2\\u00b1 13 day, Many detailed observations of jet launching in young stellar objects (YSOs) appear consistent with magnetocentrifugal models of acceleration. This has been interpreted as support for these models. There are other possibilities, however. <P />In previous work, I described how turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI) may help launch jets. As conceived and formulated, this jet launching mechanism is not magnetocentrifugal. The MRI-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence creates hoop-stresses both on and above the midplane, and I suggested that these confine and collimate the outflow. This is fundamentally different from far-downstream hoop-stress collimation of jets beyond the Alfv\\u00e9n surface such as occurs in traditional magnetocentrifugal jet mechanisms. Indeed, in standard MHD wind theory, the hoop-stress must vanish on the midplane. <P />There now exist substantial observational constraints on several quantities fundamental to jet launching in YSOs, including the ratio of jet mass flux to accretion mass flux, the jet thrust, and the jet angular momentum flux. Here I show that this consistency is not as robust a test of magnetocentrifugal acceleration as might be hoped. <P />In particular, I construct a non-magnetocentrifugal jet model based on MRI-driven turbulent jet confinement and collimation. I show how this model may explain jets in YSOs consistently with the observational constraints, especially in high accretion-rate systems. Finally, I discuss potential observational discriminants between this preliminary model and the magnetocentrifugal class of models., X Muscae is amongst the stars listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars as \\\"not studied.\\\" Visual observations by the author during the 5-year interval 1999 through 2003 indicate this is a large amplitude variable star, probably of the Mira type. A visual magnitude range of 12.2 to fainter than 15.0 is found with a mean cycle of 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 days. A preliminary ephemeris for determining maximum brightness is JD 2452085 + 266 \\u00c2\\u00b1 7 E days., Supergranulation is a well established component of solar convection and visible on the solar surface as cellular structures. The convective upflow within a supergranule cell overshoots the equilibrium solar surface creating a corrugated surface. The hills associated with these upflows have been detected as they pass over the solar limb. Their discovery was initially attributed to Rossby waves, arising from r-mode oscillations in the Sun where the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. We analyze these hills by producing an artificial height map derived from the radial component of supergranule Doppler velocity data constructed from the spectral components of a synthetic photospheric convection spectrum. We are able to show that the observed signals leading to the detection of these solar hills can be modeled by applying the same methods that lead to the Rossby wave `discovery', prompting the conclusion that the corrugation has its origins in supergranulation., We present a method that employs the secondary eclipse light curves of transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary atmosphere previously published by Cooper &amp; Showman. We find that observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,'' which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC observations at 3.6\\u03bcm of a single secondary eclipse should permit sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper &amp; Showman model of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a similarly robust detection., , We discuss non-self-gravitating hydrodynamic disks in the thin disk limit. These systems are stable according to the Rayleigh criterion, and yet there is some evidence that the dissipative and transport processes in these disks are hydrodynamic in nature at least some of the time. We draw on recent work on the hydrodynamics of laboratory shear flows. Such flows are often experimentally unstable even in the absence of a linear instability. The transition to turbulence in these systems, as well as the large linear transient amplification of initial disturbances, may depend upon the non-self-adjoint nature of the differential operator that describes the dynamics of perturbations to the background state. We find that small initial perturbations can produce large growth in accretion disks in the shearing sheet approximation with shearing box boundary conditions, despite the absence of any linear instability. Furthermore, the differential operator that propagates initial conditions forward in time is asymptotically close (as a function of Reynolds number) to possessing growing eigenmodes. The similarity to the dynamics of laboratory shear flows is suggestive that accretion disks might be hydrodynamically unstable despite the lack of any known instability mechanism., Rossby waves have been well established as oceanographic and atmospheric features on Earth in which the Coriolis force acts as a restoring force on internal gravity waves. Rossby waves have also been predicted to exist as \\\"r-mode oscillations\\\" on rotating stars and the Sun. Recently, reports have claimed that such phenomena exist as low amplitude, long wavelength features - \\\"hills\\\" - on the surface of the Sun by analyzing spatial and temporal signatures of the solar limb from the MDI instrument on SOHO. We have used simulated data to conduct a similar analysis of the limb and discovered that the reported signatures can be obtained by considering only the supergranule convection pattern., Lightning and related natural electrical discharge phenomena occur on many solar system bodies, most notably the Earth and the gas giants. It has also been suggested that lightning within the protosolar nebula may explain the melt properties of meteoritic chondrules. We consider conditions under which electrical discharge might occur within the interstellar medium. Such discharge would most likely require a gas with a small ionization fraction, such as a diffuse HI region or a molecular cloud. We discuss processes that might create the electric field or emf necessary for electrical breakdown. After considering grain charging rates in turbulent gas, we estimate the magnitude of charge separation by turbulent clustering of charged dust grains, and estimate time scales for charge neutralization by the electron current. We calculate a local heating rate due to an interstellar discharge and use the appropriate cooling rates for each type of region to estimate a temperature history associated with the discharge. Possible chemical and electromagnetic signatures of interstellar lightning are discussed., , Star formation rates on the galactic scale are described phenomenologically by two distinct relationships, as emphasized recently by Elmegreen [Elmegreen, B.G., 2002. ApJ, 577, 206. astro-ph/0207114.]. The first of these is the Schmidt law, which is a power-law relation between the star formation rate SFR and the column density \\u03a3. The other relationship is that there is a cutoff in the gas density below which star formation shuts off. The purpose of this paper is to argue that: (1) these two relationships can be accommodated by a single functional form of the Schmidt law, (2) this functional form is motivated by the hypothesis that star formation is a critical phenomenon, and that as a corollary, (3) the existence of a sharp cutoff may thus be an emergent property of galaxies, as was argued by Seiden [Seiden, P.E.,1983. ApJ, 266, 555.], as opposed to the classical view that this cutoff is due to an instability criterion., P. Williams, Heathcote, New South Wales, reports his visual discovery of a possible nova (mag 10.5) on Apr. 6.565 UT, noting it to be situated 4'.8 southeast of the nearby R CrB-type variable V517 Oph (itself invisible near minimum); Williams gave the position for the new star as R.A. = 17h15m30s, Decl. = -29o09'30\\\" (equinox 2000.0).

Posters., We present results from a spectroscopic search for massive companions to dust-making Galactic WC9 stars as a step to testing the paradigm that dust formation in these systems requires colliding winds to produce over densities. We find evidence for OB companions to the WC9 stars WR 59 and WR 65, but not WR 121 or WR 117. We identify lines of N III-V and possibly N II in the spectrum of WR 88, one of the few Galactic WC9 stars which do not make circumstellar dust, and suggest that WR 88 is a transitional WN--WC9 object and less evolved than the other WC9 stars. On the other hand, the possible identification of a strong emission line at 4176 in the spectrum of WR 117 with Ne I suggests that this star is more evolved than other WC9 stars studied., , We present results from a spectroscopic search for massive companions to dust-making Galactic WC9 stars as a step to testing the paradigm that dust formation in these systems requires colliding winds to produce over densities.

One argument is based upon consideration that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, in general, and turbulence driven by the MRI, in particular, is more nearly viscoelastic than it is viscous. Another argument is based upon the dispersion relation for the MRI in the context of 1D simulations of core collapse. Yet a third argument rests in the results of direct numerical MHD simulations of collapsars and thick accretion flows. I elaborate on my previous work regarding the first argument above and I briefly discuss how these three sets of results are all related. I also discuss the different roles played by the magnetic tension and the magnetic pressure within the context of this work. I point out that this leads to consideration of the normal stress difference between the hoop stress and the radial stress, in preference to a focus on just the hoop stress itself. Additionally, I argue that simulations of thick accretion flows and collapsars are not self-consistent if they include a phenomenological model for an MRI-induced viscous stress but disregard these other MRI-induced stress components. I comment briefly on the RHESSI observation of polarization in the gamma-ray burst GRB0212206. I argue that this polarization is consistent with a tangled field, and does not require a large-scale organized field. Finally, I suggest that the role of magnetic fields in creating jets, as described here, should be understood not to work within the confines of magnetocentrifugal models of jets, but rather as an alternative to them., , , Results of 18 years observation provide the previously lacking basic catalogue data on the Mira type variable star IY Carinae. A visual magnitude range of 10.1 to fainter then 15.0 and a mean period of 283.90 days are found. An epoch for determining dates of maximum brightness is JD 2447919\\u00b1283.90 days, Oxygen and carbon data from eight stalagmites from northwest South Island are combined to produce composite records of \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O and \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C from 23.4 ka to the present. The chronology is anchored by 43 thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) uranium series ages. Delta <SUP>18</SUP>O values are interpreted as having a first order positive relationship to temperature, but also to be influenced by precipitation in a complex manner. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C is interpreted as responding negatively to increases in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and precipitation amount. Six climatic phases are recognized. After adjustment of 1.2\\u2030 for the ice volume effect, the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record between 23 and 18 ka varies around -3.72\\u2030 compared to the Holocene average of -3.17\\u2030. Late-glacial warming commenced between 18.2 and 17.8 ka and accelerated after 16.7 ka, culminating in a positive excursion between 14.70 and 13.53 ka. This was followed by a significant negative excursion between 13.53 and 11.14 ka of up to 0.55\\u2030 depth that overlapped the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR) and spanned the Younger Dryas (YD). Positive \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O excursions at 11.14 ka and 6.91-6.47 ka represent the warmest parts of the Holocene. The mid-Holocene from 6 to 2 ka was marked by negative excursions that coincide with increased glacial activity in the South Island. A short positive excursion from 0.71 to 0.57 ka was slightly later than the Medieval Warm Period of Europe. Delta <SUP>13</SUP>C values were high until 17.79 ka after which there was an abrupt decrease to 17.19 ka followed by a steady decline to a minimum at 10.97 ka. Then followed a general increase, suggesting a drying trend, to 3.23 ka followed by a further general decline. The abrupt decrease in \\u03b4-values after 17.79 ka probably corresponds to an increase in atmospheric CO <SUB>2</SUB> concentration, biological activity and wetness at the end of the Last Glaciation, but the reversal identified in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O record from 13.53 to 11.14 ka was not reflected in \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C changes. The lowest \\u03b4<SUP>13</SUP>C values coincided with the early Holocene climatic suboptimum when conditions were relatively wet as well as mild. Major trends in the \\u03b4<SUP>18</SUP>O <SUB>c</SUB> record are similar to the Northern Hemisphere, but second order detail is often distinctly different. Consequently, at the millennial scale, a more convincing case can be made for asymmetric climatic response between the two hemispheres rather than synchronicity., P. Williams, Heathcote, N.S.W., reports that this eruptive variable (cf. IAUC 4676, 4966), usually near mag 18, appears to be undergoing an outburst and is near maximum brightness for the first time since 1997, as indicated by his visual magnitude estimates: 2004 Nov. 14.493 UT, [13.5; Dec. 18.497, [13.5; 2005 Jan. 5.509, 14.0; 5.518, 14.0. CCD images obtained by C. Bembrick (Mt. Tarana, N.S.W.; mag V = 14.0) on Jan. 6.5 and by S. Lee (Coonabarabran, N.S.W.) on Jan. 6.6 confirm the current bright state., , We re-examine the Boussinesq hypothesis of an effective turbulent viscosity within the context of simple closure considerations for models of strong magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Reynolds-stress and turbulent Maxwell-stress closure models will necessarily introduce a suite of transport coefficients, all of which are to some degree model-dependent. One of the most important coefficients is the relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress, which until recently has been relatively ignored. We discuss this relaxation within the context of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in steady high fluid Reynolds-number, high magnetic-Reynolds-number shearing flows. The relaxation time for the turbulent Maxwell stress is not constrained by the shear time scale, in contrast with Reynolds-stress closure models for purely hydrodynamical turbulence. As a result, the anisotropy of the turbulent stress tensor for magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, even for the case of zero mean-field considered here, cannot be neglected. This shear-generated anisotropy can be interpreted as being due to an effective turbulent elasticity, in analogy to the Boussinesq turbulent viscosity. We claim that this turbulent elasticity should be important for any astrophysical problem in which the turbulent stress in quasi-steady shear has been treated phenomenologically with an effective viscosity., Observations of the 1.083-micron He I line in WR140 (HD 193793) show P-Cygni profiles which varied as the binary system went through periastron passage. A sub-peak appeared on the normally flat-topped emission component and then moved across the profile consistent with its formation in the wind-collision region. Variation of the absorption component provided constraints on the opening angle (theta) of the wind-collision region. Infrared (2-10 micron) images observed with a variety of instruments in 2001-04 resolve the dust cloud formed in 2001, and show it to be expanding at a constant rate. Owing to the high eccentricity of the binary orbit, the dust is spread around the orbital plane in a 'splash' and we compare the dust images with the orientation of the orbit., We report here an example of a series of computer simulations of the formation of disk galaxies, including a standard cold dark matter component, gas, and star formation, which result in objects which closely resemble observed giant galaxies, with a population of long-lived dwarf satellites which contain little or no non-baryonic dark matter., Using a set of 60 Tree-SPH simulations of the formation of an individual galaxy, including star formation physics, we quantitatively assess the numerical accuracy and convergence of these methods. For simulations using 24000 particles in total, the gross structures of the resultant galaxies are reliably resolved., In many SPH simulations of galaxy formation a lower limit is imposed on the kernel radius h equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. It has been found that such a constraint can in some circumstances compromise the spatial resolution to which hydrodynamical quantities are evaluated to the extent that the evolution of the gross features of a numerical galaxies are affected. Such effects can be avoided by allowing h to evolve freely to maintain a roughly constant number of neighbours in SPH summations. Here we focus on how imposing a constraint on h may affect the velocity field., In simulations of galaxy formation that use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to model the gas component, a lower limit on the value of the kernel smoothing radius h is often imposed, usually equal to the gravitational softening length \\u025b. In this paper we analyze a series of benchmark hydrodynamics problems and test galaxy formation simulations, aimed at quantifying the effects of imposing such a constraint on h. We have found that in some circumstances, such an approach can severely degrade the accuracy of solutions. In such cases, using large values of h results in an over-smoothed density field, i.e., a decrease in the calculated values of density \\u03c1 and density gradients \\u2207\\u03c1, which unphysically decreases the \\u2207\\u03c1/\\u03c1 part of pressure accelerations. In simulations of galaxy disks, constrained h may also result in unphysical angular momentum transfer, affecting the gross structure of the numerical galaxy. Such an effect occurs because particles in the central regions of the disk sample the velocity field in SPH summations over too large a range in velocities. We demonstrate here that when h is allowed to evolve freely to maintain a constant number of neighbors in SPH summations, such unwanted effects can be avoided and accuracy improved. At the same time, significant savings in computational cost can also be made by using the unconstrained h approach., , We have argued that magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in an accretion disk naturally produces hoop-stresses, and that in a geometrically-thick flow these stresses could both drive and collimate an outflow. We based this argument on an analogy of turbulent MHD fluids to viscoelastic fluids, in which azimuthal shear flow creates hoop-stresses that cause a variety of flow phenomena, including the Weissenberg effect in which a fluid climbs a spinning rod. One of the more important differences between the Weissenberg effect and astrophysical jets is the source of power. In our previous analysis, we only considered the power due to the spin-down torque on the central object, and thus found that we could only drive an outflow if the central object were maximally rotating. Here we take into account the energy that is liberated by the accreting matter, and describe a scenario in which this energy couples to the outflow to create a thermodynamic engine., Inertia-gravity waves exist ubiquitously throughout the stratified parts of the atmosphere and ocean. They are generated by local velocity shears, interactions with topography, and as geostrophic (or spontaneous) adjustment radiation. Relatively little is known about the details of their interaction with the large-scale flow, however. We report on a joint model/laboratory study of a flow in which inertia-gravity waves are generated as spontaneous adjustment radiation by an evolving large-scale mode. We show that their subsequent impact upon the large-scale dynamics is generally small. However, near a potential transition from one large-scale mode to another, in a flow which is simultaneously baroclinically-unstable to more than one mode, the inertia-gravity waves may strongly influence the selection of the mode which actually occurs., We discuss turbulent elasticity within the context of the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone (SCZ). The concept of a turbulent elasticity is complementary to the notion of a turbulent viscosity. In the case of turbulent viscosity, the small-scale stochastic component of the turbulent fluid motions behaves like molecules in ordinary viscous fluids to create an effective viscous response of the stress. Likewise, in the case of turbulent elasticity, the small-scale stochastic component of the magnetic field behaves like polymers in solution in viscoelastic fluids to create an effective elastic response of the fluid to stress. This elastic response creates hoop-stresses in azimuthal shear flow. We demonstrate that the hoop-stresses generated by turbulent elasticity induce a component to the meridional flow in the SCZ that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology, that is to say, north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone, for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. In fact it is commonly observed in the secondary flow phenomena of viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory that elastic forces act oppositely to inertial forces. We thus argue that the addition of a turbulent elasticity may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' One additional effect of an effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves, which are essentially Alvf\\u00e9n waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model should thus make testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum., We discuss turbulent magnetic fields and the angular momentum balance of the solar convective zone. We demonstrate that the stresses generated by turbulent magnetic fields induce a component to the meridional flow that is ``clockwise'' in the usual terminology i.e. north to south at the surface and south to north at the base of the convective zone for the northern hemisphere. This meridional flow is in opposition to the meridional flow that is induced by inertia. We thus argue that the inclusion of turbulent Maxwell stresses may help solve the so-called ``Taylor number puzzle.'' We demonstrate this by solving for the equilibrium angular momentum balance and meridional circulation using a numerical pseudo-spectral code that we describe. This code includes turbulent magnetic fields through a model that includes an effective turbulent elasticity. An additional effect of this effective elasticity is the purely elastic (as opposed to viscous) response of the fluid to shear on timescales shorter than the elastic relaxation time. The fluid should thus support transverse shear waves which are essentially Alvfenic waves in a spatially stochastic field. Our model in addition to fitting the observed solar rotation profile also thus makes testable predictions about the solar oscillation spectrum, We propose a viscoelastic model of the Maxwell stresses due to the disorganized magnetic field in MRI-driven MHD turbulence. Viscoelastic fluids in the laboratory are known to produce jet-like structures under the action of a rotating sphere. Here we argue that a similar mechanism may help explain jets in protostellar systems. Such jets would be driven not by large scale organized magnetic fields, but by the mean field stresses of small scale tangled magnetic fields., \",\n          \"The astronomical community is grappling with the increasing volume and complexity of data produced by modern telescopes, due to difficulties in reducing, accessing, analyzing, and combining archives of data. To address this challenge, we propose the establishment of a coordinating body, an \\\"entity,\\\" with the specific mission of enhancing the interoperability, archiving, distribution, and production of both astronomical data and software. This report is the culmination of a workshop held in February 2023 on the Future of Astronomical Data Infrastructure. Attended by 70 scientists and software professionals from ground-based and space-based missions and archives spanning the entire spectrum of astronomical research, the group deliberated on the prevailing state of software and data infrastructure in astronomy, identified pressing issues, and explored potential solutions. In this report, we describe the ecosystem of astronomical data, its existing flaws, and the many gaps, duplication, inconsistencies, barriers to access, drags on productivity, missed opportunities, and risks to the long-term integrity of essential data sets. We also highlight the successes and failures in a set of deep dives into several different illustrative components of the ecosystem, included as an appendix., Answering the pressing astronomical and human questions of our time\\u2014what are the origins of the Universe? how did galaxies, stars, and planets form? is there life elsewhere?\\u2014requires telescope resources beyond what individual universities or private observatories can muster, and they also require much more than the hardware. The most successful modern ground-based astronomical experiments have therefore been those that not only harnessed the resources of large consortia but also maximized their science productivity through early career training, innovative software development, and powerful and user-friendly public data-distribution tools., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as an archetypal mid-scale program, including the technical, scientific, and organizational aspects underpinning its success over the last twenty years. Based on the SDSS experience, we present six recommendations that the funding mechanisms for mid-scale programs should be designed to ensure., We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratios in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z\\u223c 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z\\u223c 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in 2016 July., kcorrect fits very restricted spectral energy distribution models to galaxy photometry or spectra in the restframe UV, optical and near-infrared. The main purpose of the fits are for calculating K-corrections. The templates used for the fits may also be interpreted physically, since they are based on the Bruzual-Charlot stellar evolution synthesis codes. Thus, for each fit galaxy kcorrect can provide an estimate of the stellar mass-to-light ratio., Michael Blanton enjoys a history of cosmology focused on large-scale structure in the 'spongy' Universe., We describe a procedure for background subtracting Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging that improves the resulting detection and photometry of large galaxies on the sky. Within each SDSS drift scan run, we mask out detected sources and then fit a smooth function to the variation of the sky background. This procedure has been applied to all SDSS-III Data Release 8 images, and the results are available as part of that data set. We have tested the effect of our background subtraction on the photometry of large galaxies by inserting fake galaxies into the raw pixels, reanalyzing the data, and measuring them after background subtraction. Our technique results in no size-dependent bias in galaxy fluxes up to half-light radii r <SUB>50</SUB> ~ 100 arcsec; in contrast, for galaxies of that size the standard SDSS photometric catalog underestimates fluxes by about 1.5 mag. Our results represent a substantial improvement over the standard SDSS catalog results and should form the basis of any analysis of nearby galaxies using the SDSS imaging data., An essential use of stellar population synthesis methods is to interpret the observations of galaxies, to infer their star-formation and assembly histories. I describe here some of the uses of these techniques over the past few years, primarily in the context of local galaxy redshift surveys. For this purpose, such surveys have both advantages and disadvantages relative to higher signal-to-noise but smaller studies, which I discuss. After discussing general issues, I describe how the substantial model uncertainties impact the analysis of galaxy spectra. Then, I discuss the special case of elliptical galaxies, arguing that investigators have made interesting discoveries even in the absence of perfect (or even good) models. I then describe the desiderata for massive higher redshift surveys and the trade-offs that must be made between cosmological and galaxy-focused science, in qualitative terms., We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types\\u2014spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems\\u2014and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys., In most cosmological theories, the galaxy mass function at small masses is related to the small-scale matter power spectrum. The circular velocity function (closely related to the mass function) is well studied for Local Group dwarfs. However, predictions and measurements are difficult for satellite galaxies because of ram pressure and tidal stripping. By contrast, isolated dwarf galaxies are less affected by these processes and almost always have 21 cm emission to trace their dynamics. Here we use isolated low-mass dwarf galaxies from the SDSS, with measured 21 cm widths, to test CDM cosmology. We find consistency between the predicted and observed number density of isolated galaxies down to V<SUB>max</SUB> ~ 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Our technique yields a direct test of small-scale cosmology that is independent of but weaker than the Ly\\u03b1 forest: warm dark matter particles heavier than 0.5 keV cannot be ruled out (for the case of thermal gravitinos). New, blind H I surveys are expected to uncover a much larger number of isolated low-mass galaxies and will increase the power of our constraints at small scales. Using our sample, we also find that the Tully-Fisher relation for dwarfs is a strong function of environment, and that the baryon fraction is only a weak function of galaxy mass. Together with the strong dependence of gas fraction on environment, these results indicate that for dwarf galaxies, gas loss and the end of star formation are dominated by external, not internal, processes., We propose here for archival research funding to measure the build-up of stellar mass over the last eight billion years, using an unprecedentedly large sample. Measuring the increase of stellar mass in galaxies, and determining its dependence on galaxy type and environment, yields crucial information about the star-formation and merger history of galaxies. This history has been the subject of intense research over the past few years, but has been limited by both systematic effects and by the sizes of the available observational samples. Our PRIMUS survey contains over 200,000 spectroscopic redshifts, measured at 1 percent precision, out to redshift z=1, covering 8 square degrees of SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging. Our sample is flux-limited at i=23 and includes all galaxy types, spanning the red and blue galaxy populations. We have created this sample using a special mode we have developed for the IMACS instrument on the Magellan 6.5m at Las Campanas Observatories: a low dispersion prism in combination with a multi-slit mask. This configuration allows redshift determination of 1 percent accuracy, while also allowing extreme multiplexing to obtain over 2,000 galaxy spectra simultaneously. With the SWIRE optical and infrared imaging in combination with our redshift determinations, we can recover much more accurate estimates of the stellar mass of each galaxy and construct a high signal-to-noise estimate of the stellar mass function over a range of redshifts. These measurements will dramatically improve our current understanding of the build-up of stellar mass, both by decreasing the statistical uncertainty due to sample variance with our massive sample, and by decreasing the systematic uncertainties in stellar masses by using the SWIRE and S-COSMOS imaging., We determine what aspects of the density field surrounding galaxies most affect their properties. For Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, we measure the group environment, meaning the host group luminosity and the distance from the group center (hereafter ``groupocentric distance''). For comparison, we measure the surrounding density field on scales ranging from 100 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc to 10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We use the relationship between color and group environment to test the null hypothesis that only the group environment matters, searching for a residual dependence of properties on the surrounding density. Generally, red galaxies are slightly more clustered on small scales (~100-300 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc) than the null hypothesis predicts, possibly indicating that substructure within groups has some importance. At large scales (&gt;1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the actual projected correlation functions of galaxies are biased at less than the 5% level with respect to the null hypothesis predictions. We exclude strongly the converse null hypothesis: that only the surrounding density (on any scale) matters. These results generally encourage the use of the halo model description of galaxy bias, which models the galaxy distribution as a function of host halo mass alone. We compare these results to proposed galaxy formation scenarios within the cold dark matter cosmological model., Template fits to observed galaxy fluxes allow calculation of K-corrections and conversions among observations of galaxies at various wavelengths. We present a method for creating model-based template sets given a set of heterogeneous photometric and spectroscopic galaxy data. Our technique, nonnegative matrix factorization, is akin to principal component analysis (PCA), except that it is constrained to produce nonnegative templates, it can use a basis set of models (rather than the delta-function basis of PCA), and it naturally handles uncertainties, missing data, and heterogeneous data (including broadband fluxes at various redshifts). The particular implementation we present here is suitable for ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;1.5. Since we base our templates on stellar population synthesis models, the results are interpretable in terms of approximate stellar masses and star formation histories. We present templates fitted with this method to data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and photometry, the Two Micron All Sky Survey, the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In addition, we present software for using such data to estimate K-corrections., Most theories of galaxy formation incorporate elements like supernova feedback, ram pressure stripping, and other poorly understood physical effects. Dwarf galaxies, with their shallow potential wells, are the galaxies most sensitive to these processes. Thus, the study of dwarf galaxies may lead to a better understanding of these effects. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, I examine the properties of dwarf satellites of luminous galaxies. By deprojecting the distribution, I determine the three-dimensional radial distribution of satellites around host galaxies. Treating blue (dIrr) and red (dE or dSph) satellites separately, I demonstrate that the trend seen in the Milky Way, that nearby dwarfs are much redder, also holds for other systems. Our results suggest that interaction with a large host is the only process which can end star-formation in dwarfs. I compare these results to theoretical predictions based on semianalytic models., In the six billion years between redshifts z=1 and z=0.1, galaxies change due to the aging of their stellar populations, the formation of new stars, and mergers with other galaxies. Here I explore the relative importance of these various effects, finding that mergers and other processes are unlikely to convert more than 10% of the blue galaxy sequence into red galaxies in that time period. I compare the galaxy population at redshift z~0.1 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to the sample at z~1 from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 (DEEP2). Galaxies are bluer at z~1: the blue sequence by about 0.3 mag and the red sequence by about 0.1 mag in <SUP>0.1</SUP>(u-g). I evaluate the change in color and in the luminosity functions of the two sequences using some simplistic stellar population synthesis models. These models indicate that the luminous end of the red sequence fades less than passive evolution allows by about 0.2 mag. Due to a lack of luminous blue progenitors, ``dry'' mergers between red galaxies then must create the luminous red population at z~0.1 if the stellar population models and flux estimates are correct. The blue-sequence colors and luminosity function are consistent with a reduction in the star formation rate since z~1 (by at least a factor of about 3, although this study does not constrain the exact number well), with no change in the number density to within 10%. These results restrict the number of blue galaxies that can fall onto the red sequence by any process, and in particular suggest that if mergers are catastrophic events, they must be rare for blue galaxies., We investigate the relationship between the colors, luminosities, and environments of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopic sample, using environmental measurements on scales ranging from 0.2 to 6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc. We find that (1) the relationship between color and environment persists even to the lowest luminosities we probe (M<SUB>r</SUB>-5log10h~-14) (2) at luminosities and colors for which the galaxy correlation function has a large amplitude, it also has a steep slope; and (3) in regions of a given overdensity on small scales (1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc), the overdensity on large scales (6 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) does not appear to relate to the recent star formation history of the galaxies. Of these results, the last has the most immediate application to galaxy formation theory. In particular, it lends support to the notion that a galaxy's properties are related only to the mass of its host dark matter halo, and not to the larger scale environment. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Interpreting surveys of galaxies which span a range of redshifts requires being able to interpret broad-band observations of galaxies taken through different effective rest-frame bandpasses. All claims of evolution of the galaxy population rely on accurate K-corrections in order to do this. The PI has written widely used software (over 100 registered users and over 100 citations in the literature) for calculating K-corrections in the UV, optical and near-infrared, and proposes to extend this software to self-consistently include the mid and far-infrared. Large public Spitzer surveys like the First Look Survey and SWIRE overlap deep (to redshift unity) public redshift catalogs, and provide an excellent basis for developing these tools. This proposal outlines a plan for developing and testing an appropriate set of templates for fitting SEDs and calculating K-corrections. The tools (in addition to furthering the PI's own work on galaxy evolution) will be publicly released., Dwarf galaxies are simple relative to more luminous galaxies, ideal for testing predictions of cosmology, of star-formation in disks, and of the effect of environment on galaxy properties. To study dwarf galaxies, we have constructed a joint sample of optical, Spitzer, and HI data, including resolved long-slit spectroscopy, showing among other things that these galaxies have extremely low star formation efficiencies. We propose to add archival GALEX data to a joint analysis of dwarf galaxies' optical, infrared, and radio properties to determine their star-formation histories and to better understand galaxy formation in this regime. We will attempt to construct a consistent star-formation history explaining the colors, metallicities, gas contents, and current star-formation rates of dwarf galaxies, and to examine how these properties vary with environment., We examine a sample of low-redshift (10 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc&lt;d&lt;150 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc) field galaxies including galaxies with luminosities as low as M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh~-12.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2). The sample is unique in containing galaxies of extremely low luminosities in a wide range of environments, selected with uniform and well-understood criteria. We present the luminosity function, as well as the broadband properties, of low-luminosity galaxies in this sample. A Schechter function is an insufficient parameterization of the r-band luminosity function; there is an upturn in the slope for M<SUB>r</SUB>-5logh&gt;-18. The resulting slope at low luminosities in this sample is \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.3. However, we almost certainly miss a large number of galaxies at very low luminosities due to low surface brightness selection effects, and we estimate that the true low-luminosity slope may be as steep as or steeper than \\u03b1<SUB>2</SUB>~-1.5. The results here are consistent with previous SDSS results and, in the g band, roughly consistent with the results of the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey. Extremely low luminosity galaxies are predominantly low surface brightness, exponential disks, the majority of which are red. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., We examine the relationship between environment and the luminosities, surface brightnesses, colors, and profile shapes of luminous galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For the SDSS sample, galaxy color is the galaxy property most predictive of the local environment. Galaxy color and luminosity-measures of the star formation history-jointly comprise the most predictive pair of properties. At fixed luminosity and color, density is not closely related to surface brightness or to S\\u00e9rsic index-measures of galaxy structure. In the text, we discuss what measurable residual relationships exist, generally finding that at red colors and fixed luminosity, the mean density decreases at the highest surface brightnesses and S\\u00e9rsic indices. In general, these results suggest that the structural properties of galaxies are less closely related to galaxy environment than are their masses and star formation histories. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC), a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z~0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, QSOs, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the SDSS. Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg<SUP>2</SUP> (with about 85% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many SDSS investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the SDSS. The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The SDSS catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the SDSS Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from ~2% to ~1%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the SDSS Archive Servers in that NYU-VAGC's calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the SDSS spectroscopic catalog. <P />Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics, New York University, 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003., We propose to use archival GALEX observations to characterize galaxy spectral energy distributions in the ultraviolet. Our goal is to create a public tool for calculating K-corrections (that is, the transformations between observed fluxes and rest frame fluxes for redshifted sources). This tool will build on and be compatible with widely-used ones we have already made public for the analysis of optical and near-infrared observations in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Two-micron All Sky Survey. A consistent treatment of ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared observations will simplify data analysis and improve comparison of low-redshift observations of galaxies (typically optical or near-infrared) to high-redshift observations (often in the rest-frame ultraviolet)., We present results on the relationship between the environments, structure, and star-formation history of galaxies, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Measures of the star-formation history, such as color and luminosity, are more closely related to environment than are measures of galaxy structure, such as galaxy concentration and surface brightness. In particular, galaxy concentration does not correlate with environment at fixed color and luminosity. These results suggest that the relationship between density and morphology may be secondary to the relationship between density and star formation history., Using photometry and spectroscopy of 183,487 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we present bivariate distributions of pairs of seven galaxy properties: four optical colors, surface brightness, radial profile shape as measured by the S\\u00e9rsic index, and absolute magnitude. In addition, we present the dependence of local galaxy density (smoothed on 8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc scales) on all of these properties. Several classic, well-known relations among galaxy properties are evident at extremely high signal-to-noise ratio: the color-color relations of galaxies, the color-magnitude relations, the magnitude-surface brightness relation, and the dependence of density on color and absolute magnitude. We show that most of the i-band luminosity density in the universe is in the absolute magnitude and surface brightness ranges used: -23.5&lt;M<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;-17.0 mag and 17&lt;\\u03bc<SUB>0.1<SUB>i</SUB></SUB>&lt;24 mag in 1 arcsec<SUP>2</SUP> [the notation <SUP>z</SUP>b represents the b band shifted blueward by a factor (1+z)]. Some of the relationships between parameters, in particular the color-magnitude relations, show stronger correlations for exponential galaxies and concentrated galaxies taken separately than for all galaxies taken together. We provide a simple set of fits of the dependence of galaxy properties on luminosity for these two sets of galaxies and other quantitative details of our results. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their rest-frame shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands <SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP>0.1</SUP>z with \\u03bb<SUB>eff</SUB>=(3216,4240,5595,6792,8111\\u00c5), respectively. To estimate the luminosity function, we use a maximum likelihood method that allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, fits for simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates the flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 expressed in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc<SUP>3</SUP> to be (-14.10+/-0.15, -15.18+/-0.03, -15.90+/-0.03, -16.24+/-0.03, -16.56+/-0.02) in (<SUP>0.1</SUP>u, <SUP>0.1</SUP>g, <SUP>0.1</SUP>r, <SUP>0.1</SUP>i, <SUP> 0.1</SUP>z), respectively, for a cosmological model with \\u03a9<SUB>0</SUB>=0.3, \\u03a9<SUB>\\u039b</SUB>=0.7, and h=1 and using SDSS Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using S\\u00e9rsic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the <SUP>0.1</SUP>r band, the best-fit Schechter function to our results has \\u03c6<SUB>*</SUB>=(1.49+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>-2</SUP> h<SUP>3</SUP> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, M<SUB>*</SUB>-5log10h=-20.44+/-0.01, and \\u03b1=-1.05+/-0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in <SUP>0.1</SUP>r is (1.84+/-0.04)\\u00d710<SUP>8</SUP> h L<SUB>0.1<SUB>r,solar</SUB></SUB> Mpc<SUP>-3</SUP>. Our results in the <SUP>0.1</SUP>g band are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millennium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change (~0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Though the details depend on their favorite galaxy formation theory, astronomers generally expect high redshift galaxies to be more luminous, smaller, bluer, and closer to exponential profiles than to de Vaucouleurs profiles, than are low redshift galaxies. Some of these predictions have been vindicated by observations of the Hubble Deep Fields and other surveys, such as the predominance of the blue population at high redshift. However, in order to distinguish between different galaxy formation theories, all of them require more consistent quantitative measurements than have yet been performed. In particular they require a consistent comparison to high quality low redshift surveys. We propose to perform just such a comparison to optical results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. To perform this test carefully, we will analyze the instrumental effects on the comparison of low and high redshift objects, including the differences in resolution, signal-to-noise, rest-frame wavelengths, and background subtraction. By defining consistent measures of color, size and profile shape which are robust to these effects we will best be able to constrain galaxy formation theory. We will release to the community the software we develop and the simulated images we produce., Broadband measurements of flux for galaxies at different redshifts measure different regions of the rest-frame galaxy spectrum. Certain astronomical questions, such as the evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies, require transforming these inherently redshift-dependent magnitudes into redshift-independent quantities. To prepare to address these astronomical questions, investigated in detail in subsequent papers, we fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to broadband photometric observations in the context of the optical observations of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Linear combinations of four spectral templates can reproduce the five SDSS magnitudes of all galaxies to the precision of the photometry. Expressed in the appropriate coordinate system, the locus of the coefficients multiplying the templates is planar and, in fact, nearly linear. The resulting reconstructed SEDs can be used to recover fixed-frame magnitudes over a range of redshifts. This process yields consistent results in the sense that, within each sample, the intrinsic colors of similar type galaxies are nearly constant with redshift. We compare our results with simpler interpolation methods and galaxy spectrophotometry from the SDSS. The software that generates these results is publicly available and easily adapted to handle a wide range of galaxy observations. <P />Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey., Large surveys using multiobject spectrographs require automated methods for deciding how to efficiently point observations and how to assign targets to each pointing. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) will observe around 10<SUP>6</SUP> spectra from targets distributed over an area of about 10,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, using a multiobject fiber spectrograph that can simultaneously observe 640 objects in a circular field of view (referred to as a ``tile'') 1.49d in radius. No two fibers can be placed closer than 55\\\" during the same observation; multiple targets closer than this distance are said to ``collide.'' We present here a method of allocating fibers to desired targets given a set of tile centers that includes the effects of collisions and that is nearly optimally efficient and uniform. Because of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution (which form the bulk of the SDSS targets), a naive covering of the sky with equally spaced tiles does not yield uniform sampling. Thus, we present a heuristic for perturbing the centers of the tiles from the equally spaced distribution that provides more uniform completeness. For the SDSS sample, we can attain a sampling rate of greater than 92% for all targets, and greater than 99% for the set of targets that do not collide with each other, with an efficiency greater than 90% (defined as the fraction of available fibers assigned to targets). The methods used here may prove useful to those planning other large surveys., Astrophysicists do not associate galaxies with the massive dark matter halos so easily detected in particle simulations and whose mass function can be predicted by the Press-Schechter formalism and its variants. Instead, they associate galaxies with smaller surviving subhalos whose contents do not fully mix into the larger dark matter halos they exist in. However, these subhalos are as of now difficult to find in simulations. I present a simple description of what the Press-Schechter formalism can say about the clustering of these subhalos, under the restrictive assumption that at fixed subhalo mass, the chance of survival of the subhalo is independent of its larger scale environment. This model predicts a weak dependence of clustering on mass below masses of about 10^12 solar masses, in agreement with observations of a weak dependence of clustering on luminosity at luminosities less than L*. The model is in qualitative agreement with observations that at low luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of color while at high luminosities galaxy clustering is a strong function of luminosity.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Identifier\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\":

The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept being assessed by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is expected to be 8 to 16 meters in diameter, have a segmented primary mirror, active control, and be diffraction limited at a wavelength of 500 nanometers. The optical stability is expected to be in the picometer range for minutes to hours. Architecture studies to support the NASA Science and Technology Definition teams (STDTs) are underway to evaluate systems performance. A wave front error budget has been developed to help define the technology needs and assess performance. The budget includes both spatial and temporal domain aspects for the active, adaptive and passive elements in the optical design., The Origins Space Telescope (OST) is a mission concept being studied in preparation for the 2020 Decadal Survey. OST will be a large space based astronomical telescope operating at mid and far Infrared wavelengths. The desire is to have the radiometric sensitivity of observations be limited by the natural celestial sky background. This will require that OST be operated at cryogenic temperatures to limit the self-generated thermal emission. The architecture has the telescope exposed to space, with a protective shield blocking exposure to direct illumination from the sun, earth, and moon. The telescope design limits the self-emission to stray light to only come from the telescope structure, baffles, and optics that are thermally controlled to \\u2248 4 K. A reverse try trace technique is used to determine the susceptibility of light from any part of the sky getting to the instrument focal plane and producing a stray light background. A Radiance Transfer Function (RTF) is derived that relates the background stray light produced at the focal plane by a patch of sky to the radiance of that patch of sky. The RTF is defined relative to the observatory reference frame. For a given pointing direction of the Observatory on the sky, the sky radiance mapped in ecliptic coordinates is transformed into the telescope reference frame and multiplied by the RTF to calculate the stray light. The sky radiance maps are from data obtained from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) mission. In addition to the sky source of stray light, a separate calculation is used to determine the self-generated IR thermal background., The James Webb Space Telescope is a large space-based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures. Because of its size, the telescope must be stowed in an inoperable configuration for launch and remotely reconfigured in space to meet the operational requirements using active Wave Front Sensing and Control (WFSC). Predicting optical performance for the flight system relies on a sequence of incremental tests and analyses that has culminated with the cryogenic vacuum test of the integrated Optical Telescope Element (OTE) and Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) referred to as OTIS. The interplay between the optical budgeting process, test verification results at incrementally increasing levels of integration, use of test validated models, and the WFSC process to produce the final optical performance predictions for final verification by analysis will be presented., This Tutorial Text provides an introduction to systems engineering principles, tools, and practices as applied to astronomical systems. Written for engineers, scientists, and managers, it is intended to aid in the transition from a discipline specialist to a systems engineer. Topics include interface control, the lifecycle model, the role of trade studies, and the flow and allocation of requirements. Particular attention is paid to deriving the law of error propagation because it is the basis for formal performance budgeting and estimating the probability of success. Several examples supplement this derivation. The book concludes with a case study for a space science mission., Future large astronomical telescopes in space will have architectures that will have complex and demanding requirements to meet the science goals. The Large UV/Optical/IR Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept being assessed by the NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center is expected to be 9 to 15 meters in diameter, have a segmented primary mirror and be diffraction limited at a wavelength of 500 nanometers. The optical stability is expected to be in the picometer range for minutes to hours. Architecture studies to support the NASA Science and Technology Definition teams (STDTs) are underway to evaluate systems performance improvements to meet the science goals. To help define the technology needs and assess performance, a first order error budget has been developed. Like the JWST error budget, the error budget includes the active, adaptive and passive elements in spatial and temporal domains. JWST performance is scaled using first order approximations where appropriate and includes technical advances in telescope control., Future large astronomical telescopes in space will have architectures that expose the optics to large angular extents of the sky. Options for reducing stray light coming from the sky range from enclosing the telescope in a tubular baffle to having an open telescope structure with a large sunshield to eliminate solar illumination. These two options are considered for an on-axis telescope design to explore stray light considerations. A tubular baffle design will limit the sky exposure to the solid angle of the cone in front of the telescope set by the aspect ratio of the baffle length to Primary Mirror (PM) diameter. Illumination from this portion of the sky will be limited to the PM and structures internal to the tubular baffle. Alternatively, an open structure design will allow a large portion of the sky to directly illuminate the PM and Secondary Mirror (SM) as well as illuminating sunshield and other structure surfaces which will reflect or scatter light onto the PM and SM. Portions of this illumination of the PM and SM will be scattered into the optical train as stray light. A Radiance Transfer Function (RTF) is calculated for the open architecture that determines the ratio of the stray light background radiance in the image contributed by a patch of sky having unit radiance. The full 4\\u03c0 steradian of sky is divided into a grid of patches, with the location of each patch defined in the telescope coordinate system. By rotating the celestial sky radiance maps into the telescope coordinate frame for a given pointing direction of the telescope, the RTF may be applied to the sky brightness and the results integrated to get the total stray light from the sky for that pointing direction. The RTF data generated for the open architecture may analyzed as a function of the expanding cone angle about the pointing direction. In this manner, the open architecture data may be used to directly compare to a tubular baffle design parameterized by allowed cone angle based on the aspect ratio of the tubular baffle length to PM diameter. Additional analysis has been done to examine the stray light implications for the fields near the image of a bright source. This near field stray light is shown to be dependent on the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) characteristics of the mirrors in the optical train. The near field stray light contribution is dominated by those mirrors closer to the focal plane compared to the contributions from the PM and SM. Hence the near field stray light is independent of the exterior telescope baffle geometry. Contributions from self-emission from the telescope have been compared to natural background for telescopes operating at infrared wavelengths., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures. The architecture has the telescope exposed to space, with a large sun shield providing thermal isolation and protection from direct illumination from the sun. The instruments will have the capability to observe over a spectral range from 0.6 \\u03bcm to 29 \\u03bcm wavelengths. Stray light analysis has been performed to characterize the stray light getting to the instrument focal planes from the celestial sky. A Radiance Transfer Function (RTF) is defined for the susceptibility of stray light to sky radiance relative to the observatory frame of reference. The stray light is calculated by overlaying the radiance maps of the celestial sky background (both galactic and zodiacal background) onto the RTF map. The product of the two is summed to obtain the total stray light background at the instrument detectors. The orientation of the observatory for observing a given field location in the sky depends on the direction of the sun, hence the day of the year. The variability of stray light with time of year for observing a given sky locations is determined., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large cryogenic telescope observing over a spectral range from 0.6 \\u03bcm to 29 \\u03bcm. A large sun shield blocks sunlight and provides thermal isolation for the optics. Analyses characterizing the stray light reaching the instrument focal planes from the galactic sky, zodiacal background, bright objects near the line-of-sight, and earth and moon shine are presented along with the self-generated thermal infrared background from Observatory structures. The latter requires thermal analysis to characterize the Observatory temperatures. Dependencies on the surface properties of BRDF and emittance are discussed for the underlying materials and the effects of contamination, The flight components for the James Webb Space Telescope optical system are built and the assembly and integration of the telescope and instrument system is in progress. The optical performance for JWST has been updated using the as-built performance of the individual components; updated predictions for alignment as the assembly and integration process has matured; and updated performance predictions for the flight stability contributors: temperature stability driven thermo-elastic deformation and dynamic response stability to flight disturbances. These updates flow from the collective product of several groups on the JWST team., The performance of an optical system is best characterized by either the point spread function (PSF) or the optical transfer function (OTF). However, for system budgeting purposes, it is convenient to use a single scalar metric, or a combination of a few scalar metrics to track performance. For the James Webb Space Telescope, the Observatory level requirements were expressed in metrics of Strehl Ratio, and Encircled Energy. These in turn were converted to the metrics of total rms WFE and rms WFE within spatial frequency domains. The 18 individual mirror segments for the primary mirror segment assemblies (PMSA), the secondary mirror (SM), tertiary mirror (TM), and Fine Steering Mirror have all been fabricated. They are polished beryllium mirrors with a protected gold reflective coating. The statistical analysis of the resulting Surface Figure Error of these mirrors has been analyzed. The average spatial frequency distribution and the mirror-to-mirror consistency of the spatial frequency distribution are reported. The results provide insight to system budgeting processes for similar optical systems., The fabrication and coating of the mirrors for the James Webb Space Telescope has been completed. The spectral reflectivity of the protected gold coated beryllium mirrors has been measured. The predicted end-of-life transmission through the telescope builds from these values. The additional phenomena that have been analyzed are contamination effects and effects of the environment for the JWST operation about the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange libration point. The L2 environment analysis has been based on radiation testing of mirror samples and hypervelocity testing to assess the micrometeoroid impact effects. The mirror showed no change in reflectance over the VIS-SWIR wavelengths after exposure to 6-9 Grad (Si) that simulated 6 years orbiting the L2 Lagrange point. The effects of hypervelocity particle impacts on the mirrors from test data has been extrapolated to the to the anticipated flux characteristics for micrometeoroids at the L2 environment. The results show that the micrometeoroid effects are orders of magnitude below the particulate contamination effects. The final end-of-life transmission for the mirrors including all of these phenomena will meet the performance requirements for JWST., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures. The architecture has the telescope exposed to space, with a large sun shield providing thermal isolation and protection from direct illumination from the sun. The instruments will have the capability to observe over a spectral range from 0.6 \\u00b5m to 28 \\u00b5m wavelengths. The following paper will present updated stray light analysis results characterizing the stray light getting to the instrument focal planes from the full galactic sky, zodiacal background, bright objects near the line of sight, and scattered earth and moon shine. Included is a discussion of internal alignments of pupils at relevant interface planes to stray light. The amount of self-generated infrared background from the Observatory that reaches the instrument focal planes will be presented including the tolerance to the alignment of the edges of the sun shield membranes relative to each other and the telescope., The James Webb Space Telescope is a large deployable cryogenic space telescope that is pointed on the sky by control of the attitude of the integrated spacecraft and telescope. The primary mirror has 18 hexagonal Primary Mirror Segment Assemblies (PMSA) that are deployed; 3 on each of two deployable wings, and 12 on a fixed central section of the Primary Mirror Backplane Support Structure. The Secondary Mirror (SM) is deployed from the Secondary Support Structure that folds out from the backplane, and the complete Telescope and Integrated Science Instrument Module are deployed in extension from the spacecraft. The resulting tolerances will result in a \\\"first light\\\" image that has a spread array of 18 individual images for each point source located within the field of view. The initial attitude of the spacecraft will be adjusted to point the telescope to a desired star field for the initial WFSC commissioning process. The deployment tolerances will result in the telescope field of view being offset from the desired location. By use of a sequence of pointings, a mosaic \\\"first light\\\" image that includes the multiplicity of the 18 misaligned segment images may be created that will allow the calibration of the offset between the telescope boresight and the spacecraft attitude control system, allowing subsequent pointing to be done accurately to a fraction of the field of view of the instruments using spacecraft attitude control., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is an infrared space telescope designed to explore four major science themes: first light and reionization, the assembly of galaxies, the birth of stars and protoplanetary systems, and planetary systems and origins of life. JWST is a segmented architecture telescope with an aperture of 6.6 m. It will operate at cryogenic temperature (40 K), achieved via passive cooling, in an orbit about the Earth-Sun second Lagrange point (L2). Passive cooling is facilitated by means of a large sunshield that provides thermal isolation and protection from direct illumination from the Sun. The large size of the telescope and spacecraft systems require that they are stowed for launch in a configuration that fits the Ariane 5 fairing, and then deployed after launch. Routine wavefront sensing and control measurements are used to achieve phasing of the segmented primary mirror and initial alignment of the telescope. A suite of instruments will provide the capability to observe over a spectral range from 0.6- to 27-\\u03bcm wavelengths with imaging and spectroscopic configurations. An overview is presented of the architecture and selected optical design features of JWST are described., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures. The telescope by virtue of its size must be stowed in an inoperable configuration for launch and remotely reconfigured in space to meet the operational requirements using active Wave Front Sensing and Control (WFSC). This paper will report on the optical budgeting process used to manage the performance of the active system. The current status of the design and verification of the optical hardware, the WFSC processes, and the total system verification modeling will be presented. More detailed discussions of the system verification by analysis will be presented in separate accompanying papers., The James Webb Space Telescope has a segmented primary mirror consisting of 18 hexagonal beryllium primary mirror segment assemblies (PMSA) that have a total collecting area greater than 25 square meters. The PMSAs are designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures (39 K) and to be actively controlled to co-phase the segments. This paper discusses the processes and testing utilized in the manufacture of these mirrors including the critical cryogenic testing performed at the XRCF facility at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The manufacturing team is headed by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp (BATC) with support from Brush Wellman for beryllium blank fabrication, Axsys Technologies for the precision machining, L3-Tinsley for the mirror polishing, and QCI for the reflective coating application., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures in an Earth-Sun L2 Orbit. The architecture has the telescope exposed to space, with a large sun shield providing thermal isolation and protection from direct illumination from the sun. The instruments will have the capability to observe over a spectral range from 0.6 \\u03bcm to 28 \\u03bcm wavelengths. The following paper will present an overview of the architecture and describe some of the features of the optical design for the JWST environment., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures.

The following paper will present the stray light analysis results characterizing the stray light getting to the instrument focal planes from the full galactic sky, zodiacal background, bright objects near the line of sight, and scattered earth and moon shine. The amount of self-generated infrared background from the Observatory that reaches the instrument focal planes will also be presented., The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large space based astronomical telescope that will operate at cryogenic temperatures, and utilizes a segmented primary mirror with active control. To achieve the science goals for JWST, the image quality over a wide spectral range is necessary. Several metrics related to the quality of the PSF have been used to capture the optical requirement to meet the science goals. We will present the requirements allocation from Point Spread Function Metrics to spatial frequency content in Wave Front Error allocations that reflect the unique forms associated with the active control aspects of the design., Some proposed architectures for large telescopes in space such as the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST) utilize a segmented primary mirror with active control. The image quality for those systems can be characterized by the quality of the point spread function (PSF). We will present results from our simulations that demonstrate the quality of the PSF at various wavelengths, as characterized by the metrics of Strehl Ratio and encircled energy fraction. These metrics capture the critical features of the PSF that ensure good spatial resolution of the core at the nominal diffraction limited wavelength without having excessive scattering into the nearby diffraction pattern for observations at shorter wavelengths. The relationship of the image quality to the spatial frequency content of the system wave front error and to the image motion that occurs during the exposure (line-of-sight jitter) are explored.\",\n          \"We report the discovery of a hot Jupiter candidate orbiting HS Psc, a K7 (\\u22480.7 M <SUB>\\u2299</SUB>) member of the \\u2248130 Myr AB Doradus moving group. Using radial velocities over 4 yr from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder spectrograph at the Hobby\\u2013Eberly Telescope, we find a periodic signal of ${P}_{b}={3.986}_{-0.003}^{+0.044}$ days. A joint Keplerian and Gaussian process stellar activity model fit to the radial velocities yields a minimum mass of ${m}_{p}\\\\sin i={1.5}_{-0.4}^{+0.6}$ M <SUB>Jup</SUB>. The stellar rotation period is well constrained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve (P <SUB>rot</SUB> = 1.086 \\u00b1 0.003 days) and is not an integer harmonic nor alias of the orbital period, supporting the planetary nature of the observed periodicity. HS Psc b joins a small population of young, close-in giant planet candidates with robust age and mass constraints and demonstrates that giant planets can either migrate to their close-in orbital separations by 130 Myr or form in situ. Given its membership in a young moving group, HS Psc represents an excellent target for follow-up observations to characterize this young hot Jupiter further, refine its orbital properties, and search for additional planets in the system. *Based on observations obtained with the Hobby\\u2013Eberly Telescope (HET), which is a joint project of the University of Texas at Austin, the Pennsylvania State University, Ludwig-Maximillians-Universitaet Muenchen, and Georg-August Universitaet Goettingen. The HET is named in honor of its principal benefactors, William P. Hobby and Robert E. Eberly., The presence of close-in giant planets indicates that inward orbital migration is likely a regular phenomenon. However, the processes by which these gas giants arrived at their locations are poorly constrained as radial velocity (RV) surveys have largely avoided young stars. Young stars exhibit intrinsic astrophysical RV \\\"jitter\\\" primarily driven by rotationally-modulated starspots which can overwhelm planetary signals at visible wavelengths. Moving into the near-infrared (NIR) has been shown to reduce this variability. We are carrying out a large precision RV survey of intermediate-age (20-200 Myr) GK dwarfs in young moving groups with the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF), a stabilized high resolution, NIR spectrograph located at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The primary goal of this program is to determine the timescale and dominant physical mechanism of giant planet migration by measuring the occurrence rate of warm Jupiters at young ages and comparing this to established frequencies at older ages. In this talk, I will summarize the survey design and initial results, including the first candidate young planets to emerge from this program., Developments in the stability of modern spectrographs have led to extremely precise instrumental radial velocity (RV) measurements. For most stars, the detection limit of planetary companions with these instruments is expected to be dominated by astrophysical noise sources such as starspots. Correlated signals caused by rotationally modulated starspots can obscure or mimic the Doppler shifts induced by even the closest, most massive planets. This is especially true for young, magnetically active stars where stellar activity can cause fluctuation amplitudes of \\u22730.1 mag in brightness and \\u2273100 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> in RV semiamplitudes. Techniques that can mitigate these effects and increase our sensitivity to young planets are critical to improving our understanding of the evolution of planetary systems. Gaussian processes (GPs) have been successfully employed to model and constrain activity signals in individual cases. However, a principled approach of this technique, specifically for the joint modeling of photometry and RVs, has not yet been developed. In this work, we present a GP framework to simultaneously model stellar activity signals in photometry and RVs that can be used to investigate the relationship between both time series. Our method, inspired by the FF ${}^{{\\\\prime} }$ framework of Aigrain et al., models spot-driven activity signals as the linear combinations of two independent latent GPs and their time derivatives. We also simulate time series affected by starspots by extending the starry software to incorporate time evolution of stellar features. Using these synthetic data sets, we show that our method can predict spot-driven RV variations with greater accuracy than other GP approaches., We determine the distance to the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal via three Population II stellar distance indicators: (a) the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB), (b) RR Lyrae variables (RRLs), and (c) the ridgeline of the blue horizontal branch (HB). High signal-to-noise, wide-field VI imaging that covers an area $48^{\\\\prime} \\\\,\\\\times \\\\,48^{\\\\prime} $ and reaches a photometric depth approximately 2 mag fainter than the HB was acquired with the Magellan-Baade 6.5 m telescope. The true modulus derived from Sculptor's TRGB is found to be ${\\\\mu }_{o}^{\\\\mathrm{TRGB}}=19.59\\\\,\\\\pm \\\\,{0.07}_{\\\\mathrm{stat}}\\\\,\\\\pm \\\\,{0.05}_{\\\\mathrm{sys}}$ mag. Along with periods adopted from the literature, newly acquired RRL phase points are fit with template light curves to determine ${\\\\mu }_{{W}_{I,V-I}}^{\\\\mathrm{RRL}}=19.60\\\\pm {0.01}_{\\\\mathrm{stat}}\\\\pm {0.05}_{\\\\mathrm{sys}}$ mag. Finally, the HB distance is found to be ${\\\\mu }_{o}^{\\\\mathrm{HB}}\\\\,=19.54\\\\pm {0.03}_{\\\\mathrm{stat}}\\\\pm {0.09}_{\\\\mathrm{sys}}$ mag. Absolute calibrations of each method are anchored by independent geometric zero-points, utilize a different class of stars, and are determined from the same photometric calibration. *Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program No. 13691. Additional observations are credited to the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Science for the use of Magellan-Baade IMACS., The presence of giant planets interior to the water ice lines of Sun-like stars indicates that inward orbital migration is a common phenomenon. However, the processes by which these gas giants arrived at their present-day locations are poorly constrained because previous radial velocity surveys have largely avoided young stars. Young stars have intrinsic astrophysical RV \\\"jitter\\\" that overwhelms planetary signals at visible wavelengths. Moving into the NIR has been shown to reduce this variability, opening the possibility of finding giant planets around young stars. We are carrying out a large precision RV survey of intermediate-age (20-200 Myr) GK dwarfs in young moving groups with the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a stabilized high resolution, near-infrared spectrograph located at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The goals of this program are to determine the timescale and dominant physical mechanism of giant planet migration by measuring their occurrence rates at young ages and comparing them to established frequencies at older ages. In this talk we will present the survey design and initial results, including the first measurements of stellar jitter at J-band for a large sample of young Sun-like stars, and an overview of the first candidate planets to emerge from this program., We report the discovery of two transiting planets around the bright (V = 9.9 mag) main-sequence F7 star TOI-1670 by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. TOI-1670 b is a sub-Neptune ( ${R}_{{\\\\rm{b}}}={2.06}_{-0.15}^{+0.19}$ R <SUB>\\u2295</SUB>) on a 10.9 day orbit, and TOI-1670 c is a warm Jupiter ( ${R}_{{\\\\rm{c}}}={0.987}_{-0.025}^{+0.025}$ R <SUB>Jup</SUB>) on a 40.7 day orbit. Using radial velocity observations gathered with the Tull Coud\\u00e9 Spectrograph on the Harlan J. Smith telescope and HARPS-N on the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, we find a planet mass of ${M}_{{\\\\rm{c}}}={0.63}_{-0.08}^{+0.09}$ M <SUB>Jup</SUB> for the outer warm Jupiter, implying a mean density of ${\\\\rho }_{c}={0.81}_{-0.11}^{+0.13}$ g cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The inner sub-Neptune is undetected in our radial velocity data (M <SUB>b</SUB> &lt; 0.13 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> at the 99% confidence level). Multiplanet systems like TOI-1670 hosting an outer warm Jupiter on a nearly circular orbit ( ${e}_{{\\\\rm{c}}}={0.09}_{-0.04}^{+0.05}$ ) and one or more inner coplanar planets are more consistent with \\\"gentle\\\" formation mechanisms such as disk migration or in situ formation rather than high-eccentricity migration. Of the 11 known systems with a warm Jupiter and a smaller inner companion, eight (73%) are near a low-order mean-motion resonance, which can be a signature of migration. TOI-1670 joins two other systems (27% of this subsample) with period commensurabilities greater than 3, a common feature of in situ formation or halted inward migration. TOI-1670 and the handful of similar systems support a diversity of formation pathways for warm Jupiters., We present early results from the Epoch of Giant Planet Migration program, a precise radial velocity (RV) survey of more than 100 intermediate-age (\\u223c20-200 Myr) G and K dwarfs with the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph (HPF) at McDonald Observatory's Hobby-Eberly Telescope. The goals of this program are to determine the timescale and dominant physical mechanism of giant planet migration interior to the water ice line of Sun-like stars. Here, we summarize results from the first 14 months of this program, with a focus on our custom RV pipeline for HPF, a measurement of the intrinsic near-infrared RV activity of young Solar analogs, and modeling the underlying population-level distribution of stellar jitter. We demonstrate on-sky stability at the sub-2 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> level for the K2 standard HD 3765 using a least-squares matching method to extract precise RVs. Based on a subsample of 29 stars with at least three RV measurements from our program, we find a median rms level of 34 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is nearly a factor of 2 lower than the median rms level in the optical of 60 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> for a comparison sample with similar ages and spectral types as our targets. The observed near-infrared jitter measurements for this subsample are well reproduced with a log-normal parent distribution with \\u03bc = 4.15 and \\u03c3 = 1.02. Finally, by compiling rms values from previous planet search programs, we show that near-infrared jitter for G and K dwarfs generally decays with age in a similar fashion to optical wavelengths, albeit with a shallower slope and lower overall values for ages \\u22721 Gyr., The presence of giant planets interior to the ice lines of Sun-like stars indicates that inward orbital migration is a common phenomenon. However, the processes by which these gas giants arrived at their present-day locations are poorly constrained because previous radial velocity surveys have largely avoided young stars. We are carrying out a large precision RV survey of intermediate-age (50-250 Myr) GK dwarfs with the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a stabilized high resolution, near-infrared spectrograph located at the Hobbly-Eberly Telescope. The science goals of this program are to determine the timescale and dominant physical mechanism of giant planet migration. We will present the survey design and initial results, including the first measurements of stellar jitter at J-band for a large sample of young Sun-like stars., The relative age of various sections of the large ribosomal RNAs can be deduced from long-range interactions such as the A-minor motif that emerged over time in a directional manner. The utility of GNRA tetraloops as timing elements is investigated.\",\n          \"As the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) came online last summer, we entered a new era of astronomy. This new era is supported by data products of unprecedented information content that require novel reduction and analysis techniques. Recently, Niraula et al. (N22) highlighted the need for upgraded opacity models to prevent facing a model-driven accuracy wall when interpreting exoplanet transmission spectra. Here, we follow the same approach as N22 to explore the sensitivity of inferences on the atmospheric properties of WASP-39 b to the opacity models used. We find that the retrieval of the main atmospheric properties from this first JWST exoplanet spectrum is mostly unaffected by the current state of the community's opacity models. Abundances of strong opacity sources like water and carbon dioxide are reliably constrained within ~0.30 dex, beyond the 0.50 dex accuracy wall reported in N22. Assuming the completeness and accuracy of line lists, N22's accuracy wall is primarily driven by model uncertainties on broadening coefficients and far-wing behaviors, which we find to have marginal consequences for interpreting the transmission spectra of large, hot, high-metallicity atmospheres such as WASP-39 b, in opposition to emission spectra and climate modeling, which depend on deeper parts of a planetary atmosphere. The origin of the opacity challenge in the retrieval of metal-rich hot Jupiters via transmission spectroscopy will thus mostly stem from the incompleteness and inaccuracy of line lists., With a new generation of observatories coming online this decade, the process of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres will need to be reinvented. Currently mostly on the instrumental side, characterization bottlenecks will soon appear at the models used to translate spectra into atmospheric properties. Limitations stemming from our stellar and atmospheric models have already been highlighted. Here, we show that the current limitations of the opacity models used to decode exoplanet spectra propagate into an accuracy wall at ~0.5-1.0 dex (that is, three- to tenfold) on the atmospheric properties, which is an order of magnitude above the precision targeted by James Webb Space Telescope Cycle 1 programmes and needed, for example, for meaningful C/O-ratio constraints and biosignature identification. We perform a sensitivity analysis using nine different opacity models and find that most of the retrievals produce harmonious fits owing to compensations in the form of &gt;5\\u03c3 biases on the derived atmospheric parameters translating into the aforementioned accuracy wall. We suggest a two-tier approach to alleviate this problem, involving a new retrieval procedure and guided improvements in opacity data, their standardization and optimal dissemination., With a new generation of observatories coming online this decade, the process of characterizing exoplanet atmospheres will need to be reinvented.

In this paper, we refute the planetary nature of three previously validated planets\\u2014Kepler-854 b, Kepler-840 b, and Kepler-699 b\\u2014and possibly a fourth, Kepler-747 b, using updated stellar parameters from Gaia and phase-curve analysis. In all four cases, the inferred physical radii rule out their planetary nature given the stellar radiation the companions receive. For Kepler-854 b, the mass derived from the host star's ellipsoidal variation, which had not been part of the original vetting procedure, similarly points to a nonplanetary value. To contextualize our understanding of the phase curve for stellar-mass companions in particular and extend our understanding of high-order harmonics, we examine Kepler eclipsing binaries with periods between 1.5 and 10 days. Using a sample of 20 systems, we report a strong power-law relation between the second cosine harmonic of the phase-curve signal and the higher cosine harmonics, which supports the hypothesis that those signals arise from the tidal interaction between the binary components. We find that the ratio between the second and third-harmonic amplitudes is 2.24 \\u00b1 0.48, in good agreement with the expected value of 2.4 from the classical formalism for the ellipsoidal distortion., Space-based photometric missions widely use statistical validation tools for vetting transiting planetary candidates, particularly when other traditional methods of planet confirmation are unviable.

The planet has a period of \\u223c3.14 days, i.e., \\u223c\\u03c0, with an installation of 7.45 S<SUB>\\u2295</SUB>. The detection was made using publicly available data from K2's Campaign 15. We observed three additional transits with SPECULOOS Southern and Northern Observatories, and a stellar spectrum from Keck/HIRES, which allowed us to validate the planetary nature of the signal. The confirmed planet is well suited for comparative terrestrial exoplanetology. While exoplanets transiting ultracool dwarfs present the best opportunity for atmospheric studies of terrestrial exoplanets with the James Webb Space Telescope, those orbiting mid-M dwarfs within 100 pc such as EPIC 249631677b will become increasingly accessible with the next generation of observatories., We have systematically searched for the planetary phase curves among the planets discovered by K2. Using the planetary parameters, we filter out the best candidates, and examine their light curves in detail for the potential presence of the phase curve. For our work, we consider light curves from two different detrending pipelines - EVEREST and K2SFF. In order to remove any stellar and systematics, we use different flattening techniques and perform a detailed injection-retrieval test in order to understand the reliability and completeness of our pipeline to extract the phase curve. In this talk, we report potential phase curves for five planets observed with K2, two of which appear to be robust. However, we find the phase curve fit parameters are not consistent with the known RV masses, and therefore dive deeper into the reasons why such discrepancies could arise and potential ways for mitigating them., We have systematically searched for the phase curves among the planets discovered by \\\\textit{K2}. Using the reported planetary parameters, we screen out the best potential candidates, and examine their light curves in detail. For our work, we consider light curves from two different detrending pipelines - \\\\texttt{EVEREST} and \\\\texttt{K2SFF}. In order to remove stellar variability and systematics, we test three different filtering techniques: spline, phasma (median-filtering) and Butterworth (harmonics filtering), and use Butterworth filtered light curves for the subsequent analysis. We have identified 6 previously unreported phase curves among the planets observed with \\\\textit{K2}: K2-31b, HATS-9b, HATS-11b, K2-107b, K2-131b, and K2-106b. The first four of these are hot Jupiters for which we find the photometric masses consistent with their RV-based masses within 2$\\\\sigma$, 1$\\\\sigma$, 1$\\\\sigma$, and 3$\\\\sigma$ respectively with comparatively low geometric albedos, while the last two are ultra-short period super-Earths with phase curves dominated by reflective and thermal components. We also detect a secondary eclipse in HATS-11b at 62$\\\\pm$12 ppm. We thus deem it to be possible to validate the planetary nature of selected \\\\textit{K2}, and suggest similar vetting could be used for the ongoing \\\\textit{TESS} mission., We report on the discovery of three transiting planets around GJ~9827. The planets have radii of 1.75$\\\\pm$0.18, 1.36$\\\\pm$0.14, and 2.11$ _{- 0.21 }^{+ 0.22 }$~R$_{\\\\earth}$, and periods of 1.20896 , 3.6480, and 6.2014 days, respectively.

The radial velocity follow-up, high resolution imaging, and detection of multiple transiting objects near commensurability drastically reduce the false positive probability. The orbital periods of GJ~9827~b, c and d planets are very close to the 1:3:5 mean motion resonance. Our preliminary analysis shows that GJ~9827 planets are excellent candidates for atmospheric observations.
